# Toby's Life Story - Chapters 1-4

## Chapter 1: The Beginning

I was born in Greenwood Springs Colorado and shortly after moved to Modesto California with my mom, leaving my 2 older brothers and father behind. It seemed that they didn't get along anymore and it was time for my mom to head back to her family in CA.

From what I was told, we lived with my grandmother for the first couple of years. The earliest memories I have was when I was about 3-4 and it was just my mom and I living in a 2 bedroom apartment. As I got older, I remember the amazing times I had with my grandparents. My grandmother was an amazing lady who I loved more than anything. She always made me chocolate chip cookies and hot apple pies, which I still love more than anything today. She was a very sweet but powerful lady and commanded so much love and respect it was enlightening. She was the very best there was.

As the years went on, I asked many times about my 2 brothers and father that still lived in Colorado and I envied them because they had each other. I wanted to get to know them and be apart of their life, but it wasn't an option. My Dad and Mom hated each other with a massive passion and things were just how they were.

As I got older, my mom remarried to a guy who was a total jerk. He was about 6'4 and thought he was the best thing since sliced bread. I couldn't stand him. Not for one minute. He hated me because I demanded my mom's attention and was a wedge in between them. Needless to say I acted out a lot and was always getting into some kind of trouble. Either at school or just in the neighborhood. But this kept me in the spot light with my mom and it caused serious issues.

By the time I was 10 years old, my Step dad and mom had had enough and decided it would be great for me to go spend the summer with my real dad and brothers. By this time my real dad had remarried and moved to a dairy farm in Oklahoma. The deal was that I would go there for the summer, spend time getting to know them, live out in the country and perhaps grow up a little and get this rebellion streak out of my system. Once the summer was over I would then come back or, if I wanted I could stay there for the school year and we would take it year by year.

This was the most amazing thing I could have ever expected. I wanted to get to go live with my dad and brothers who I barely knew, live in the country, shoot guns, help raise cattle and more importantly, get away from the one man who hated me more than anything else.

## Chapter 2: From Chaos to Calling

### Section 1: Reclaiming My Roots

California had started to lose its shine. The promise of a fresh start out West had faded into long days and even longer nights of soul-searching. I realized this wasn't it. This wasn't where I was meant to plant my flag.

I needed to get back to where I came from. Back to the red dirt and the rolling hills. Back to the roots that had raised me, challenged me, and shaped me. It was time to return to Oklahoma.

Word had gotten to me that my older brother, Tim Potter, had opened up a landscape nursery business in Miami. Coincidentally, I'd picked up some landscaping skills while working out in California. It felt like a sign. A door cracking open. A chance to start over—not from scratch, but from strength.

So I loaded up my truck with everything I owned. Every duffel bag, every hard lesson, every scar. And I headed east. Back to Oklahoma. Back to blood. Back to what I hoped could be the beginning of a new story.

The drive gave me time to reflect. California had matured me. Life had forced me to grow up fast, to figure things out in a sink-or-swim world. Now, there was a hunger inside me—not just for survival, but for purpose. I wanted more than just a paycheck. I wanted identity.

Reuniting with my brothers, reconnecting with family—maybe that was the answer. Maybe that's where I would finally find my direction.

By the time I pulled into Miami, I wasn't the same young man who had left. I had weathered storms. But now I was back—with tools in my hands, lessons in my back pocket, and a fire in my chest.

I felt this was a great opportunity for me to make a name for myself.

It didn't take long for me to find my rhythm in Miami. I moved in with my brothers Tim and Jeff, and began working full-time at the nursery. What started out as a job quickly became a mission to prove myself—not just to them, but to everyone watching.

There was something special about the town of Miami. It was small, tight-knit, with a pulse that beat through the college and the community. You couldn't sneeze in that town without someone noticing. And I wasn't exactly laying low.

One of Tim's contracts was maintaining the flower beds and planters throughout downtown. It was the kind of gig that required someone to walk those streets daily, watering by hand. That someone was me.

Every afternoon, I'd head out there with a hose and a mission—but not in a T-shirt. No, this was a show. I was working out hard, getting ripped, proud of the physique I had carved out. So I went shirtless. Every day. 99% of the time, the shirt stayed off, the confidence stayed high, and the attention followed.

The strip downtown became my stage.

Friday afternoons were a show within a show. The main drag in Miami would fill with cars, college kids, locals cruising, trying to see and be seen. And there I was, front and center. Working. Flirting. Owning every glance.

I built a reputation—not just as the guy without a shirt, but as someone you didn't want to cross. I had learned to fight back in California—learned how to anticipate, dominate, and win. I wasn't just brawling; I was executing.

Before long, people started coming to me with their problems. Someone had a beef? A bully needed to be taught a lesson? Bring me a six-pack, and I'd handle it. After four or five beers, I'd load up in the truck, find the guy, and settle it the old-fashioned way—with fists.

I was a one-man wrecking crew, fueled by pain, pride, and beer.

And it became every Friday, Saturday night, I fought somebody.

I realized early on—this wasn't it.

All the fighting, the adrenaline, the popularity... it was smoke. Fleeting. For a while, it felt like power. But I wasn't building anything. I was just reacting to the world, not creating my own.

I wanted more. I *needed* more.

One day, I met a guy—a freshman at NEO, Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College—who was studying criminal justice. He talked about becoming a cop, going into law enforcement, and something about that hit me. It stirred something real inside.

I thought: maybe that's it. Maybe that's my next fight. Not in a parking lot. But in the real world. Maybe I could work my way up to SWAT, or federal law enforcement. Maybe even something bigger.

That night, I sat with it.

I had the physical tools. I had the mental edge. And I had this growing fire inside me that needed to be aimed at something meaningful.

So I enrolled at NEO.

The path was clear: criminal justice with a pre-law focus in political science. If I played it right, I could crack my way into the Secret Service, maybe even the CIA.

For the first time in a long time, I wasn't fighting to hurt—I was fighting to become.

That was the beginning of a great future for me.

By spring of my sophomore year, I was riding high. I had a purpose. I had direction. But I still had that fire—that hunger to prove something big.

So I dreamed up something legendary.

A party. Not just a Friday night kegger. No. I was going to throw the *biggest party this town had ever seen*. I called it Spring Bash of '88.

It wasn't just about beer. It was about legacy.

I went full throttle. I secured a federal park location, paid the $200 lease, and pitched it as a celebration with volleyball, frisbees, music, and "refreshments." We weren't *selling* alcohol—we were selling an experience.

The ticket? Six bucks if you bought early. Ten at the gate.

Then I brought in my crew—Derek and Darren Ferguson. These dudes looked like the Barbarian Brothers, straight out of a late-80s action flick. Massive, built, and dumb as bricks, but they could work a crowd and hustle like champions.

We printed T-shirts, tank tops, and hats with our Spring Bash logo. People started buying the merch just to say they were part of it—even if they weren't coming. It was marketing magic, and the cash was flowing.

The day of the party, cars rolled in like a concert. Football players, basketball teams, entire student cliques—everyone came. Hundreds of people packed the park, music was blasting, and the air was electric.

This was *it*. This was the moment I was king.

Until the badge showed up.

A guy pulled up in an unmarked car. Looked like a coach or a parent. I asked how many tickets he needed. He flashed a badge.

"I'm ATF," he said. "And I'm coming in."

Just like that, the vibe snapped. Behind him were ten more cars—sheriffs, undercover agents. Like a scene out of a movie.

I tried to keep it cool. Told them I had receipts. That everything was accounted for.

But then the detail that broke the world slipped out.

Some of the beer—twelve kegs—had been picked up in Missouri.

That meant 6% beer.

That meant crossing state lines.

That meant *bootlegging*.

When the ATF officer realized that, his face changed. I was read my rights, cuffed, and shoved into the back of a squad car—with over 300 people watching.

The legacy I'd built in sweat and swagger had just gone up in smoke.

But the story didn't end there.

My boys had stashed five kegs in a truck that hadn't been searched. While I was being booked, they took them to my house and *restarted the party*. When I got out hours later, they greeted me like a fallen king. Sixty people. Five kegs. And a legend reborn.

And trust me, for the next six hours, we drank the shit out of those five kegs, partied our asses off, and just lived life to the fullest.

After Spring Bash of '88, the dust settled—but the fire inside me didn't. I had walked a tightrope of chaos and charm, and I knew if I didn't course-correct fast, I'd fall. That party could've ruined everything. But somehow, I slipped through the cracks.

And that's when something unexpected happened.

At Central State University in Edmond, Oklahoma, I crossed paths with a Marine Corps recruiter. We talked about law enforcement, government service, and everything in between. I told him straight—I wanted in. Not just in the Marines. I wanted access to something greater: dignitary protection, CIA, Secret Service.

He didn't flinch.

"If you're serious," he said, "you can do this. But you've got to qualify."

It wasn't just paperwork and promises. This was an elite pipeline. If I made it, I'd graduate as a second lieutenant. I'd bypass the grunts and go straight into commanding units—possibly even securing roles at the White House, embassies, Pentagon assignments.

But first, I had to pass every single test.

For the next six weeks, I was under the microscope—written tests in math, English, logic, science. Then came the simulations. They handed me booklets that mimicked flight manuals. Fighter pilot logic. What happens when you pitch left, roll right, bank hard, correct course? I had no clue. I wasn't a pilot. I was a fighter—on foot, in the dirt. And that test? I failed miserably.

But that didn't end the journey.

They pushed me toward officer qualification without the aviation track.

And then came the crucible—the physical exam.

Pushups. Sit-ups. Chin-ups. Every day. Higher reps. Shorter breaks. No mercy. The recruiter trained me like I was already enlisted.

The final gauntlet? A five-mile timed run.

The rules were simple: beat the recruiter, or beat the clock.

We started early that Saturday morning. I was bulked from years of lifting—strong, but not built for distance. That run broke every part of me. My legs were jelly. My lungs burned. My mouth felt like sandpaper. And still—I stayed on his heels.

At mile four, something shifted. My brain screamed to quit. My body begged to collapse. But something deeper took over. A fire born on the streets of California, fueled by hay bales in Oklahoma, sharpened through every brawl and betrayal. It screamed back louder:

*DON'T. YOU. DARE.*

I saw it in my head—I was going to win. Not because I was faster. But because I *refused* to lose.

At the final bend, I roared. My legs screamed. My breath disappeared. But I *passed him*—barely. Then collapsed, chest heaving, heart exploding, eyes wild with pride.

But I passed.

And that's when I knew.

No matter where I came from. No matter the chaos. No matter who doubted me—especially the man I tried my whole life to impress...

I had just become the man I was always meant to be.

## Chapter 4: The Turning Point

A few days passed and I decided to head back over to Bill Langley's office to see what my options were. He had called all his friends, we had poked under every rock we could find and nothing was happening. I really had no clue what I was going to do and I really was getting kind of stressed. As I walked in and sat down in Bill's office, we got to talking and he reached into his desk door and pulled out a book. It was a small book labeled "See You at the Top" by Zig Ziglar. He said, "Toby, take this book, go home, read it front to back. Do what it says. And then come back and see me. But do not come back until you've read this entire book."

Bill stated that if I were to read this book, go through it, fully understand it, there may be some hope after all. So I took it. I went home, and I began reading. And for the first time in my life, this resonated with me. Everything about this book held true to what I believed. Zig Ziglar had a way of really sharing the future, as I saw it. Telling me how great I am, how amazing I can be, how positive I needed to feel and that if I would just understand the gifts have been given to me, the talents that I have put those into action I can achieve my goals and aspirations for life.

I read that book front to back and was ecstatic. Immediately after completing the book, I sat down and started mapping out my future. I had this master plan. I knew I had a college degree, I knew I had a degree in law enforcement, and I knew it was the direction I needed to go. So I mapped out who's hiring, what Police Department can I get hired, and there was no way I was going to be a cop there in Stillwell, Tahlequah or even in Oklahoma. I was sick of this place. I was fed up. I needed a new life. I needed a change of scenery. I needed a different direction and I remembered back in high school a Dallas recruiting company had come to school and had shared with us about the Dallas Police Department and that they're always hiring and how much they make and that, you know what, I can go to Dallas, I can get on and I can start climbing that ladder to the government agency of police and law enforcement.

So I mapped it all out. I mapped out everything that Zig said in that book as to how much money I had, how much time I needed, how everything would be allocated and planned to the letter. And I wrote out this master plan and excitingly, I drove back to Bill Langley's office 4 days later. Ran into his office and said "I got it."

And I sat down there and shared this dream, this vision, this aspiration. And if anybody knows me now, I was the same then when I saw something, when I believed in something, passion oozed from my body. Excitement. I was stoked. As I shared the whole master plan with Bill, you could see a little grin come across his face. You can see life back in his eyes. And as we talked and shared and tweaked the plan, he said, "Son, I think you got a great plan there. Now let's make it happen."

He then reached into his pocket and pulled out his checkbook and said "how much money do you have?" And I told him I have $605.00 to my name but I can make it work. He said "no, that's not going to be enough, I'm going to write you a check for another $1500. Because I want you to succeed, I want you to make this happen, and I believe in you. Just like the book said."

I told Bill, "I promise you this, Sir, I don't know when and I don't know how, but I will make you proud. I will pay this back tenfold. I will make something of myself and you will be the one person that I acknowledge that helped me get to where I'm at today."

I loaded up my 1985 Chevy 4 by 4 with all my clothes and everything that would fit in the cab and I headed South to Dallas and I remember making that drive. Now mind you, I didn't know anybody. I hadn't been to Tulsa. I maybe been to Oklahoma City. But I hadn't really been anywhere, much less cross the state line, other than to go get beer in Missouri. But here I was trekking 200 miles South to a big metro city like Dallas, TX.

And I remember driving, it was late in the evening, late in the afternoon. And I drove, it was raining. And I've probably been on the road for about an hour. And here's the other thing. This is back in 1990-1992, there were no GPS, Siri, Google Maps. It was none of that. I had no clue I had a map. I had an old Rand McNally map. And I was following I-75 S. I knew nothing about this place and I knew nobody here.

But I remember driving down, I was about an hour, hour and a half into the drive and I just started praying. I just started talking to God. And I said, "You know what, Lord? I turn all this over to you. I have no clue of where I'm going to end up, what I'm going to do, but I do believe in you. I've surrendered myself to you and now I am devoting and dedicating my life to you. So wherever whatever it is in your hands." And by the time I got done praying I looked up and I am in Arlington, TX. On 360. And I'm like, "Oh, my word."

So I immediately found a hotel that allowed you to rent a room for the week. I had enough money to cover that and the journey began. I started making applications for the Dallas Police Department, the Irving Police Department, the Arlington Police Department, anybody that was taking applications, I was filling it out and the process was not immediate.

I did find some security jobs where I could do some corporate security work while I was waiting, while I was going through the onboarding and interviewing and physical fitness and all that and along the way at one of the corporate companies called Bell Northern Research, they were a technology company in Richardson, TX right on 75 and Beltline and I started working there late the late shift, 3rd shift and every morning this executive lady would come in and we would have the most amazing chat.

She would ask me "what book did you read?" And because I had shared with her about my book with reading Zig Ziglar and all that. I was learning and I was reading it for the third or fourth time and then I had picked up Napoleon Hill's "Think and Grow Rich." And on and on. And she was just enthralled by my enthusiasm. And we hit it off and for a month or two, every morning she would come in and we would talk about what I'd read that night and what I'd learned and all the dreams that I had.

And somewhere along the line, we got to talking about what I had done up in Miami, OK and I had shared with her that I had worked for my brother Tim at his landscape company. And so spring was coming around and she had asked me, "hey, would you be interested in some side work? I need my flower beds done."

And so I obliged and said "absolutely." I met her on a Saturday morning at her house and trust me, her flower beds were horrendous. They were ugly. They were in bad shape. Bermuda Grass. Shanghai. Plants dead. I mean you couldn't tell where the yard stopped and the flower bed started. It was ugly.

So we visited about what she wanted and how she envisioned them to look. I gave her a price and then I also told her "I don't have any tools." She politely walked me over to her garage and showed me a wall of shovels and picks and rakes and all kinds of tools. She said "Anything you need, you just get it and go." And I began working, and so I was only able to work a few hours during the week but I would work every weekend and that trusty old truck would haul me all the way from Arlington all the way to Richardson, back and forth.

I had finally saved up enough money and gotten an apartment and it was not two weeks after I moved into that apartment there on 75 and Forest Lane to where that old Chevy pickup limped on its last leg. I went to get in at one day, fired it up, put it in reverse and it didn't move. I put it in drive, it didn't move. I crawled out, looked underneath, it was just a puddle of oil. Transmission had gone out and I was in a bad spot.

So now here I am in an apartment complex, needed to get to this lady's house to continue working on her yard and no way to get there. So I immediately called her, shared with her the situation and her advice was "hey, why don't you call a salvage yard and see if they'll give you some money." Not a bad idea. So I grabbed the Yellow Pages because again, we're in the early 90s, no Internet, no cell phones, nothing like that, but I did have Yellow Pages.

I grabbed the Yellow Pages, went to salvage yards and started calling. I had gotten a hold of three different salvage yard companies and had arranged for all three of them to come to the truck at the same exact time. Because I wanted them to bid against each other and they didn't know it. They showed up, I showed them the truck, we fired it up, we showed what the problem was, and the bidding war went. First guy offered me $500, next guy offered me $700. Next guy offered me $800, then $850, then $900, then $950 to $1000. And $1000 to me in 1992 was a lot of money.

I took it, he brought his tow truck, hauled it off and now had $1000 cash in my pocket. But I still had no way of getting anywhere. So the next thing I did was get a cab ride to a car rental place, rented a car, then got the newspaper out the want ads and looked for a vehicle that I could afford. It was for sale. Now mind you I was pretty humble, really didn't need a whole bunch, but I did need transportation and I didn't have a lot of money.

And the best thing I could find there was this old Ford Exp hatchback. I called the young lady who had it for sale, she said it was still for sale. I drove over, I looked at it, I gave her cash and I drove it home and had the car rental place pick up the car. The car was as big of a lemon as you can imagine. But you know what? It got me to and from each place I needed to be. The only problem is, is it would overheat after when the temperatures outside got into the 90s and in Texas to the hundreds, I could go about 10-15 miles, 20 miles maybe it would overheat. I'd have to pull over the side of the road, lift up the hood, let it cool off and take off again.

But anyway, so I finished up the job with this lady's house. Working at the Police Department was not going so well. I was still had a tremendous amount of anger, tremendous amount of pain over all the past with my dad and the way things turned out. And I took a lot of that anger out on a lot of people. So my stint with the Police Department was very short lived, but now I had the landscaping company. I had done this lady's yard, her neighbors had contacted me to do their yards. And so it's picking up quite a bit of work from that.

And I had shared that my position at the Police Department was not working out the way I had hoped. And this lady said, "you know what, son, it might be good for you to do landscaping." Now I did turn to her and say "ma'am, I have no tools." We struck a deal right then and there. She said that if I would mow her yard, weed eat and edge, trim her flower beds, and keep everything as precious as it was right now, I could use all her tools, her mower, her weed eater, her blower, her shovels, her rakes. Anything she had in the garage I could use for free. But the catch was that I had to maintain her yard and I said "you got a deal."

I immediately picked up two or three yards there in her neighborhood and the next thing I did was go and create Flyers and drive neighborhoods and drop Flyers into mailboxes. So I would mow 2-3-4 yards, I would work on flower beds and in my free time I would drive neighborhoods and I would put these cheesy flyers into people's mailbox and I picked up job after job after job after job.

And about 6-8 months into it, I was mowing yards left and right, couldn't keep up. The next thing you know, one of the families that I was mowing said that they wanted a new cedar fence. I'd never built a cedar fence. But they asked "hey, can you build us, redo the fence that's there? We want it, a brand new cedar fence, remove all the pine and put up cedar." I said "heck yeah."

And the first thing I did was go to the Yellow Pages, found a lumber company that sold cedar fencing pickets, drove over to them and asked them "How do you build a cedar fence?" And they laughed but explained to me "this is how you do it." I said "good, I need a cedar fence, I need all the materials." And they placed the order, told me how much it was. I went back to the homeowner, doubled the price and told him how much it was going to be. They gave me 50% down. I paid the Cedar Supply Lumber company and they delivered materials and I went to work and it was just me.

And then the next thing I know, another client wanted a patio done and he wanted pavers, landscape pavers patio done. And of course I said "absolutely, what does it look like?" And so he showed me in a newspaper article what he was looking for. I drove to Home Depot, found the pavers, found a little brochure in the aisle where the pavers were being sold, saw that there was a company called Pavestone Pavers in Irving, and I loaded up and headed to Irving.

And I said, "hey, I got a guy who wants a patio, here's the dimensions, what do I do?" And right then and there they showed me, "well, here's how you take the dirt out, here's how you smooth it up. You bring in a load of sand, make it nice and level. Then you put these in there, pack them down, sand it in while all you're done." I said, "great, if this is the dimensions, how much?" They quoted the cost. I doubled the cost to the homeowner. He said "absolutely, let's do it." And off we were.

And for the next year I picked up job after job after job. Eventually that little Ford Exp hatchback was not cutting it and I had enough money and I traded it in and bought a nice Chevy S10 pickup, which I thought I was stepping in high cotton at that time. I mean here I was putting all over Dallas, TX going from Arlington, to Richardson, to Farmers Branch, to Carrollton. I was all over the Metroplex, had no clue and didn't care because I was living the American Dream. I was doing what I wanted, when I wanted, how I wanted, and loving life. And I gave God all the glory.

So I finally bought the PSTN. And I now felt like I had arrived. My next best biggest contract a lady had gotten one of my flyers and she had just built this massive 6,000 square foot house and she needed a full yard done. She wanted it flowerbeds, sod, the whole works. Now if anybody knows what the soil is like in Texas, it's that dad gum black Clichy clay, and when you pack it in, it packs like concrete.

I didn't know this, I'm from Oklahoma. We had Flintstone rocks and good soil. I've never seen dirt this hard and I had to dig out about 3 1/2 foot of her flower bed to get it down to put a retaining wall in and that took me almost two weeks to do. And she would come out and kept telling me, "hey, why don't you go get some of those day workers over at such and such" had no clue what a day worker was. But I figured it out and then next thing you know, I've got 5-6 guys working. We're tearing this thing up, we're building this job out and we are the hit of the town.

Because one thing I did was I did the labor cheap. I covered my material, I covered my daily expense, but everything else was pretty cheap and it was word of mouth all over the place. The next big contract we got was US Homes. They had heard that I had built this really nice retaining wall out of wallstone and they wanted this contracted on all their subdivisions, whether it be a retaining, a railroad retaining wall or a paver wall, stone, whatever the homeowner chose, they needed a contractor to come in there and I was the guy to do it.

And by this time I'm a year and a half in, I've got 14 guys on a crew. I've got a one ton Crew Cab pickup, a 1978 Crew Cab pickup. I've got a 1979 half ton Chevy pickup. I've got a 1991 or 92 Dodge Dooley. I mean, we were stepping in high cotton. Had a full crew and I had found a gentleman in Wylie, TX who had four acres of land that he wanted to lease out. I had run into him. He's an older gentleman, Roy Jacobs and amazing older gentleman, just the coolest dude I've ever met. But he leased that land to me.

We moved the construction trailer in and I opened up Potter Landscaping and Nursery and we had a landscaping crew doing all the US home jobs. Was the sod it was the 8 foot cedar or pine fencing, All the retaining walls? We were doing two or three jobs a day for them and then we were picking up all these maintenance crews or maintenance jobs throughout all the neighborhoods. We had two maintenance crews going full time. We had a full time landscape company that was doing all the US homes and residential landscaping.

And then we had I had slowly opened up a retail nursery because I needed supplies for the plants and I had heard about if you go down to Alexander, Louisiana, they have the biggest shrubs for the cheapest price and so I would load up that Dodge truck with a 16 foot trailer with 4 foot side walls on it. And I would head to Louisiana, I would load it up with all the shrubs I could haul in it and I would come back and we would go to town and we were churning and burning.

I had moved out of the apartment and moved into a single wide trailer there in Wylie which is about a half a mile from the retail nursery and this trailer was a dump. One of my subcontractors who had a dirt hauling company had owned this trailer house and after a couple of jobs I'd worked, he'd worked for me on and doing some dirt work, he had asked me if I wanted to move closer to my nursery and he said he had a trailer house that a guy just moved out of that was available for rent for like $200 a month.

And I'm like, "so you got a trailer house? It's a 3 bedroom, 2 baths. On an acre, acre and a half, it's like a half a mile from my nursery. And you want $200 a month?" He said, "Yep, and you can do it however. You could clean it up. You can leave it like it is. It doesn't matter." And so I said, "deal."

I drove out there and this trailer house was a dump. The first thing I did was pull all the carpet out, all the furniture out, all the appliances out. I mean it was nasty. I spent the whole weekend cleaning because I hate filth. The one thing that the dairy farm embedded in me was I had told myself I would never, ever, ever be around filth again and it's the one thing I could not stand.

And this trailer house was a dump. I took the refrigerator outside, set it on the ground and started hosing it down and the cockroaches came out by the hundreds. It was unbelievable, the stove. Nasty, greasy cockroach heaven. It took me the full weekend just to get all the dadgum bugs out. And I don't know how many of those bug bombs I use, but I spent all the money I had bombing that thing down. And I had told myself I'm either going to burn this trailer down, I'm going to kill all the bugs in it once something's going to happen.

Now that I got all the appliances cleaned, I'd removed all the carpet, I'd hauled it all off, I'd hauled off all the furniture, but I had no money. I mean, I'm still cash poor. I'm working my ass off and I got money coming in, but it was going out just as fast. So the next thing I did was every time we were on a job site, I would drive the neighborhoods because one of the things that happened a lot in Richardson and in Plano and Allen was neighbors would put furniture out on the street curb to be hauled off.

And I was on demand for the job. I found carpet, I found couches, I found recliners, I found entertainment systems, I found all my furniture. I even found a water bed. And by gosh, I was one happy guy I completely refurnished that apartment or that trailer house? I want to say new carpet, but it was used, new carpet, new furniture. I then built some bookshelves and all this stuff and made it a home. This was all mine.

I couldn't have been prouder. I couldn't have been more happy with the accomplishment than now. I had a home, I had a business down the road, I had this trailer house all to myself and it was 100% mine. I remember I still have the pictures of that trailer house. I think I still have the pictures of that refrigerator sitting outside.

Shortly there after I had met a gentleman at one of the nurseries in Dallas. He they were a retail nursery, but they would also sell wholesale to landscapers and they had really good shrubbery. And so when I was running short on job materials you can run over there and pick up miscellaneous stuff. And this gentleman's name was Randy Roper, and he was quite a character. Great guy, lots of fun, full of energy. Total bullshitter or total bullshiter. But he and I hit it off well and after about a month or two I'm getting to know him and hanging out and going out to clubs with him.

He came to me one day and said, "hey, man, I gotta move out of the apartment that I'm in. Do you know any place that anybody that's looking for a roommate?" And I said, "well, I've got a three bedroom, 2 bath trailer house in Wylie. I'll charge you I don't know, let's say $200 a month and you can live there." And he said "deal" now here, this guy's going to pay me $200 a month and my rent was $200 a month. So now I'm living rent free.

So we moved in with became really good friends. And it is amazing how God does things, how he lines people up and we have no clue what's in store? My landscape company, maintenance company was all going full-fledged and I had made a vow that I was done running around, done going to the clubs, that it was time to settle down. It was time to really come true to my vow to God that I was going to focus everything I could on my time and energy to become the best that could become and it was the running around that bar hop and then all that needed to come to a stop.

And so one day I was out mowing all by myself. It was a late night, that the crew was running on some other jobs. And so I grabbed a mower, weed eater and edger and headed over to one of the clients would have been one of the last jobs for the night, but it was getting late. So I ran over there and was mowing this yard and I remember it is is is It was happening right now.

I was mowing and I started talking to God. And I said, "God, I'm ready. I'm ready for a partner. I'm ready for a future with the most amazing woman. You will ever hand to me, but God, I need this person to have specific characteristics." And I remember this. I'm not making this up. This is the absolute truth, ladies and gentlemen.

I said, "God, I want her to be a country girl. Not a cowgirl, but a country girl, somebody that's pure of heart. Your word is your bond. And that she will roll up the sleeves and do whatever it takes to get the job done. That she will not just be a spouse, but to be a business partner. To be by my side to the good, the bad, the thick. But then no matter what, how, no matter how bad it gets or how good it gets, we never lose sight of who we are and our future together."

"And Lord, I just, you know, I know I've dated a lot of blondes and I've always said that my first child is going to be a blonde haired, blue eyed girl, and she's gonna think that I hung the moon and walked on water all at the same time, but but God, I don't want a blonde wife, I want a brunette. And I want her to love horses and love the outdoors and love the country and I want her to just be pure and honest. That's what I'm asking, Lord. So when you're ready and you have that presented to me. Because I'm ready, I'm ready."

And I finished mowing that yard and went about my business and time passed and I came home late one night. I had been out building a railroad tie retaining wall at US homes. It was a big job and we've been at it for 12 hours straight. I was covered in dirt. You guys covered in dirt and filth and exhausted my body ache, my muscles hurt. I had scratches on my arms from hauling those railroad ties and I flopped into that trailer house and Randy said, "man, you got to get dressed, jump in the shower. We gotta go."

I'm like, "man, I ain't going anywhere." Randy goes "no, no, no, no, no, you got to go. We gotta go. I want you to go with me tonight. I've got an old friend who's in from college. She's just went through a major break up and her and her girlfriend are going out and we want to go. I want to go and hang out and I want you to go as I want you to be my wing man."

I'm like "Randy man. I'm tired. Look at me. I'm exhausted." He says, "dude, do me a favor please. I've been trying to go out with this girl for a long time. The other girl, I know her, we're good friends. She's got me in with her. I just need a wingman just so I'm not a third wheel because" I mean, he just literally begged me and I'm like, "no, I don't want to go," but anyway I did.

I jumped in the shower, got classed, said "dude, we'll go, but we're coming home early, so that's fine. That's fine." Anyway, I jumped in the shower and got cleaned up and the deal was we were going to meet them on 75 right there in front of a restaurant. And then we're just going to follow them or jump in their car. I said "we're gonna meet him at a restaurant around 75, and then we were going to jump in their car and head down to Electric Cowboy down in Dallas."

And so we came out a while into Richardson and pulled over behind this Mustang and this most amazing, beautiful brunette steps out of the passenger side of the car wearing red Rocky Mountain jeans red boots. And was and and I never saw her face. I only saw the backside. And I was madly in love.

And I looked over to Randy. I said "Roper. I'm gonna marry that girl right there." He started laughing. I mean, I didn't even get the words out of my mouth. He started laughs, said, "yeah, good luck, buddy." I said, "no, that's her. I'm going to marry that girl right there." He said, "no, you're not, but let's have fun. You keep thinking that and let's have fun tonight."

And I said, "Randy, I'm telling you right here, right now, that's the girl. You said you only met her," I said "I know, I don't need to. I'm gonna marry her."

Anyway, he continued to chuckle. We got out, got in the car, and I knew instantly when I saw her eyes, when I saw the beauty. When I saw the power of God sitting beside me. I knew this was the one. We went to the club, we had fun, we danced. And they disappeared. Literally got up from the table left and didn't come back. 20-30-45 minutes later I look at random like "where'd they go?" "They left" I'm like, "what do you mean they left?" "yeah they left. One of her boyfriends showed up and they left"

I'm like "what do you mean one of her boyfriend now they said that she just went through a major break up" "yeah that was about a month or two back she's been back for a little bit but she's kind of, you know, running around some of these Cowboys running. She's a big barrel racer and blah, blah, blah."

I'm like, "you got to be kidding me. What do you mean they left?" So anyway, we grabbed a cab, we headed home. I was pissed, so very pissed. I waited a couple days and I thought, "you know what, I'm going to give her a call and find out what the heck's going on."

So I gave her a call. We chatted on the phone and I asked her, "hey, let's go out." "No, I can't go out. I got a barrel race coming up down in, I don't know, Austin, San Antonio, somewhere." I said "alright, when you gonna be back?" She told me. I waited a few days, called her again, asked her how her barrel racing went. She we chit chatted. I said "hey, let's go out." "No, I'm kind of busy. I got to do this." Anyway, it was excuse after excuse after excuse.

For 30 days, I called relentlessly, called and asked her out. Finally, I wore her ass down. She said, "yes, we'll go to dinner." And that's what, "let's just go to dinner." And I knew, I knew in my heart, mind and soul, this was the girl. This was the woman that I was going to spend the rest of my life with. So there's no way in hell I was given up.

She agreed to go out to dinner. I went to pick her up and I remember I showed up her mom, who had just gone through major surgery. Her mom had been kicked about a month or so earlier in the face by a horse, had half her cheekbone caved in, and she was sitting on the couch. She was heavily medicated, obviously, and wasn't the prettiest lady I'd ever seen, but was in a lot of pain.

But they tell me now that Angie goes, "yeah, the date from Hell's here, I guess I better go." I came in and introduced myself and her mom goes. "Well, at least she's cute." And I just kind of chuckled. Anyway, we went to dinner and I took her to Red Lobster. And I can tell you this, ladies and gentlemen. The power of God took over because that was one of the best dates ever for me and for her. And I will tell you this also, she was in love at the end of that date. At the end of that night when I dropped her off, I knew I had her.

We dated. We had fun and we grew very, very close together. After about four or five months of dating, she started helping me out at the landscape nursery on weekends and evenings and on her days off. And after about 6-7 months, I realized couple things. Number one, I'd already known so the woman I was gonna marry #2 she was working for me, and I had no money to pay her.

So the next best thing was, "well, let's get married, right?" So I popped the question. We got married. And neither one of us have ever looked back. It was amazing.

As I write this book, as I dig deep into this chapter. We have been married 30 years. She has been my rock, she has been my life support, she has been my inspiration. Every time there was a dark side of life. She was the bright shining light to cut a path for me to follow. When I tell you that I prayed for this lady and I visualized what I thought she would look like. The day I met her on the side of Hwy. 75 in front of Humperdinck. That's the name of the restaurant Humperdinck. Standing there when she got out of the car, I knew instantly who she was and that she was directly a divine intervention from God. Never had a doubt. Never. Not one time.

As I said today, we've been married 30 years. We have two amazing, beautiful daughters. And the amazing thing is she is a brunette with brown eyes. I was brown hair, brown eyed. I'm now gray but our first child was a blonde hair, blue eyed, amazing beautiful girl. And she was such an amazing inspiration to me. To not only know when I was 17-18 years old, I told my sister-in-law when I worked in Miami, OK at the nursery for my brother, I'd always tell my sister-in-law. We'd sit around chit chat and I'd say, "you know what? My first child is going to be a beautiful, amazing blonde hair, blue eyed little girl and she is going to just be my everything. It's gonna be daddy, daddy, daddy run and hug me and fill me full of life and energy. That is my goal in dreaming life."

And when I married Angie that same sister-in-law came out and said. "How you gonna get a blonde hair blue eyed girl out of her?" I said "you watch because with God all things are possible." And our first child came one year later, September 23rd, 1995. An amazing beautiful blonde haired blue eyed girl.

I still had the landscape company and we were still running and gunning. I was working for about two in the morning till about nine, 10:00 at night, running down to Alexander, Louisiana, picking up shrubs, running crews, running left and right. Taylor was born. And she was probably about two months old maybe a little older, but I remember I came home early one night. It was about 6:30-6:36, and Angie said, "you know, I was vacuuming and I was cleaning the house, and I kept watching Taylor and she was following me around the room. Her head was moving, her eyes removed. She recognized me. She saw me. She was looking for me."

And right then and there I made a decision that I no longer was going to work 20 hour days and miss this little Angel growing up. I got up the next morning, went into the landscape nursery, gathered all my crews and said, "hey guys, I'm shutting the doors, I'm selling the business, I'm out. I don't want to do this anymore."

And about 30 days later, we sold the landscape company, sold the nursery, sold everything with it. And I just, I wasn't going to let my little girl grow up and me not be a part of it. She was my world. She was the first person. And this is really hard to say without choking up, but she was the first person that I ever truly understood what unconditional love was. I love that little girl more than anything.

It was at that time in my life that I understood what dying for somebody meant. I would have done anything to protect her. I would have whooped 10 massive assholes to save her. To protect her, I would have done anything and I wasn't about to let her grow up without her knowing her daddy. So I sold the company.

And we had a family friend, Joe and Stacy Champion who had a mortgage company and they were doing mortgages and they were living really, really good life. And at that time in the early 90s, refinances were all of a big thing prior to the early 90s. Interest rates are in the 12-14, 13% interest rates. And in the early 90s, the Clintons, Bill Clinton, had gotten into office and had changed the interest rates and brought the interest rates down and everybody was refinancing.

So I called Joe up and I said, "hey, buddy, I've sold my landscape company. And I think I want to get into mortgage banking. Is there any way I could just come sit with you at your house?" They worked out of their house. "Could I just sit with you and come watch and see what you guys do and see if this is something that I could do?" "Absolutely, buddy. Come on over."

And so Monday through Friday, I worked side by side with him and I learned everything about the mortgage business. I learned about the refinancing, the purchases, the terminology. I understood this business so quick and so easily. It was unbelievable. Within two weeks I was already taking applications.

And what I would do was we I would go over to Joe and Stacy's, we would work from about 8:00 till about two and then I would run over to Kinko's. And when I make about 200 Flyers that I had created. And I would have Angie drive the car and I would go mailbox to mailbox putting in these Flyers on how, if you wanted to refinance and save hundreds of dollars each month, give me a call.

And we did that every day for about 60-90 days. And we closed them loans and Oh my gosh, it was so easy. I closed alone and I get paid. I'd close the loan. I got paid. And guess what? I had no payroll. I had no inventory. Had no overhead, so everything I earned went straight to the bank and for the first time in my life we had money. It's unbelievable.

And after about 90 days, four months, I realized that one of the things that I really, really enjoyed was being able to offer the American Dream of homeownership. And so I started looking at options to be able to do loans through FHA and Joe and Stacy really weren't FHA fans. They had gotten burnt by it early in their career and they just kind of stayed away from it. But it was something that I liked being able to offer people with less income, less credit, less money to be able to have the opportunity to get into home ownership and have the right to be part of the American dream. It was a vision and a passion I had.

So shortly thereafter I decided to go work for a company called Omni Mortgage and they offered FHA loans and Marie Briault was the owner of Omni Mortgage and she was an amazing lady. You talk about a firecracker who was a great leader, a great inspiration. Just was amazing. She took us in even though I had very little to no experience. I had closed maybe 6-7-8 deals but I shared with her who I was, what I wanted to do and what help I needed and she took us in and I learnt the FHA Rules and guidelines. And it took off immediately. It was one of the fastest things that I'd ever seen take off.

And here's the thing that I always knew, I always believed I could sell snow to Eskimos. I could sell anything to anybody if there was value to it. I started selling when I was 5-6 years old back in California every summer. I would want a toy and on the back of the magazine, of the comic books back in California, there's all these toys, whether it be a hot rod race car, whether it be a GI Joe, whether it be I don't remember. There's all these toys on the back of it. And all you had to do was sell gift cards, boxes of gift cards, and for every box of gift cards you got points. And once you racked up so many points, you could trade those in for a gift on the back of that magazine.

So every summer I would tell my mom, "here's the toy, I want it take 200 boxes." She would order the boxes. They would come in and I would go door to door at the age of five, 6-7 years old to all the neighbors and sell all those boxes. And the minute I sold them all, I turned in the tickets and I get my toy. So selling was easy for me because there was value. If you can create value, you can sell anything to anybody because nobody wants to be sold. People want to buy things they need that have value. And I understood that early in life.

So here it was in the mortgage industry. People want to have home ownership. People want to. Going home, they just didn't know how and I was the guy that could help them understand, create the value and seal the deal. I became the number one loan officer in this branch. In the first six months I was closing 3-4-5-6 million dollars in loans a month and the next guy was closing one or two or three, but they were all doing a paper mortgages. They wanted the bowl with the 700 FICO score that had been on the job for 10 years and it had, you know, a great IRA, 401K savings plan and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Everybody wanted them.

And here's the problem with that. They would work 20-30 days, get that bar ready to clothes and that bar would go with another mortgage company because they could get a better rate by an eighth of a percent or they could get it by saving $200 in closing costs. I mean, there was no loyalty to those customers and I had no interest in that. I wanted the customers that understood the value that I was bringing to the table. I wanted the customer that appreciated my hard work, and that was a customer who had been turned down by everybody else in town.

But when they talked to me, I never said no. I said "let's make it happen." And we strategized, we built a plan to get them approved. And I was one of the best. In fact, my bank that we sold those loans to was Countrywide Home Loans and I became one of their top loan officers the first year. All through FHA, because here's the deal. When you have a Hispanic family who's been told no, that you don't qualify because you your credits in the six hundreds and you've only been on your job for a couple years and you've got no credit, you've only got maybe a car payment or maybe a small credit card. That's it. You don't qualify. Doesn't make them bad people.

What I saw was a huge opportunity. I saw the ability to say, "you know what? But yeah, you've got that car note, but you also got car insurance, right? You pay that every month. Yeah, You got. You got electric bill. Yeah. You pay that every month? Yeah. You got a phone bill? Yeah, you pay it every month. Yeah, you got." And we would find 6-7 different items that they paid every month that had one 2-3 years of pay history. And we would get letters from those institutions. We would send those letters to the credit bureaus and the credit bureaus would add that to the credit port.

So when underwriting saw that credit report, they would say, "huh, they got 6 lines, 7 lines, 8 lines of credit, perfect pay history for the last two years. Yeah, they pay their bills." That's all that mattered. We would get them in there for 3% down 7 1/2% interest rate and they got a piece of the American dream of home ownership. And when we did that for one client, guess what they told everybody? They told their friends, they told their coworkers, they told their neighbors. They were my biggest billboard and we rock'n'roll.

So after about a year and a half, two years of working for Marie, there came a point in time where I needed to be on my own. So we opened up at that point in time a company called Imperial Mortgage Corporation. And we're going to continue this American dream. I really had no desire to do anybody who wanted a Fannie Freddie loan at the lowest interest rate with the lowest fees. I just, I couldn't stand it. It was not in my DNA to tolerate those prima donnas. I wanted the client that respected and appreciated what I did. And we marketed it, we advertised it and we grew.

So in 1990, four, 1995, trying to think here, I think in 1995, 1996, we opened up Imperial Mortgage Corporation and we grew, we had about 25-30 loan officers because it was simple to explain, simple to teach, simple to educate and simple to grow. And we brought in loan officers. We showed them what we did and how we did it. And the company was unbelievable.

And about 1996-1997 I ran into a realtor who was now one of the biggest sellers of Pulte homes. And she was looking for a lender to help her solidify all her clients to get them mortgages. And so we were the company. We were the company that could take care of all of Pulte Homes. And then of course, I had a relationship with the US Homes. So we met with them. And our biggest clients were Polti, US Homes and Engle Homes. They needed somebody that could close these $250,000 houses immediately, and that's what we did. We were able to take them and run with them.

And here was the neat thing, when we fully mastered this, we could take a client who had maybe some small credit issues, but limited credit was limited on money because they didn't know how to save money. And we would say, "OK, here's the deal, we're going to go take you over here. The US homes and Pulte homes, you're gonna find a floor plan that you like and we're going to contract, get you contracted with them because it would take 90 days to 120 days for them to build your house. But during that time, while that house is being built, you are to get your credit and your finances in order and we're going to give you a blueprint of what to do and how to do it."

We would tell them to go up, "go get a cell phone, go get utilities in their name, go get their car insurance with the real insurance company. Go to the tote, the note guy and get you a car if your car, if you, if you had a piece of crap car," whatever it did, we needed five to six lines of credit. Utilities, everything, and we would get that on there and then we would say, "alright, on every paycheck you gotta set X amount of money aside into a savings account."

And here's how we ensured that this worked. Can you imagine living in an apartment, husband and wife, 3 or 4 kids and one or two under apartment that you're sick of and now you just went into contract for a three bedroom, 2 bath brand new house. We showed you the model home. You were able to pick out your floor plan. What's the first thing you're going to do? You're going to go show your friends and family your new home. You're going to show all your neighbors. You're going to show all your coworkers.

And every week we would take them by to show them the progress of their house. And the first day they would show up and they we got the foundation poured. And then next week we'd show up and they bring a couple friends and "we got the house framed." And then the next week they show up and "we got windows in the roof." And you know what? By the time we got the sheetrock and all the cabinets in, they were bringing 8-10-12-15 people to walk that house, showing everybody.

And they were excited and they weren't about to fail because they would not only be letting themselves and their family down, but they'd also be letting all their friends down. So trust me, they got their credit built, they got their finances stabilized. They got savings built up. They did everything we asked because come day 90 they were ready to close. We'd submit that file to underwriting, the underwriter would approve it, they close and fund and guess what? 10/12/15 other families would be calling us the next day we did this. Repeatedly.

1998, I got tired of doing all this and showing all the Realtors how we did it and them taking our clients to another mortgage company for lower rates and lower payments. So I bought a re/max franchise, said "you know what, Realtors aren't loyal so I'm going to own my own Realtors." So I bought a re/max franchise in 1998. And I hired 25 Realtors and I showed them what we were doing and I told him, "you go take these clients that I bring to you, go find them a house, a brand new ground up construction house and you walk them through it each week. Your job is to walk them through that house each week. Them, their neighbors, their family, everybody you can round up, have them meet you there each week." And this is what we did.

And in 2000, I bought a title company because the builders started complaining that we couldn't close after hours and we couldn't close on Saturdays and we had to run their deals through their title companies. And I didn't like that, so I bought a title company. I had also bought an appraisal company. So by the year 2002 I had a mortgage company that was doing 10-15-20-30 million a month with about 35 loan officers at a re/max franchise with 25 agents that was closing 10-15 deals a month. I had an appraiser who was doing about 200-3 hundred appraisals month and we had the title company that was closing every deal we could bring in hand over fist we were stepping in high cotton.

It's about that time that the girls were growing up and we had our second daughter Amber was born in 1998 this is the one time that that God and I didn't get it right because I had told everybody that when Angie got pregnant that I was going to have a son. I knew it was going to be a son even after Angie had her first sonogram. I told the doctor, "you're wrong. It's it's a boy. Sorry that your sonogram is not working right. No big deal."

We even drove up to Pryor, OK, where my best friend the gentleman Brett Gray, Dr. Brett Gray, who was the best man in my wedding. I'd known Brett since 4th grade. We'd wrestled together, We've grown up together. We had just almost we're closer than than my brothers say he's basically is my brother. But anyway, he was a doctor up in Pryor, OK? We drove up there and I had him do the sonogram and he's like, "looks like a girl." I'm like, "well, you're just as dumb as the last doctor. It's a boy. Because, you know, I got this thing with God, I got this thing with God, and I know it's going to be a boy. So don't worry about it. I ain't worried about it."

You know, I heard a long time in life. If you want to make God laugh, just tell him your plans. If you want to make God laugh, just tell him your plans. Well. Amber was delivered November 20th, 1998. And they delivered her and the doctor said "congratulation. You have a daughter" and I can tell you, my wife will tell you. The expression on my face was fury, was disappointment, was aggravation. I knew in my heart, mind and soul that she was a boy. And she wasn't. She was a daughter.

But I will tell you this, one of the things that concerned me when, when Angie had gotten pregnant, you know, Taylor was my first real love. She was the one human that helped me understand what true Love Is All about. And I did. I devoted everything I had to that little Angel. She could do no wrong. She was perfect. But when Angie got pregnant with Amber, I was scared. I mean, how do you love another child, as much as you love the first one, how do you how do you not neglect one because of the other? I couldn't understand it.

I had a hard time sharing this unconditional love that I had for Taylor with my wife, who was who was everything that I had ever asked for, but the love was different because Taylor was pure, she was innocent and she saw no wrong in me and therefore she was amazing. And now I got this other one coming along. How? What would I do? And I prayed long and hard, scared to death. That she would get neglected, that she at the time he would be mistreated or or or just left out.

But I do remember that day, November 20th, 1998, when she was delivered and I held her in my arms. God gave me so much love to give her. There was never a problem, there was never a question. And the amazing thing was that little Toot grew up to be my right hand. Buddy, everywhere I went, Taylor was the cheerleader, Taylor was the Barbie doll, Taylor was the I wear dresses and I dress up and all that stuff. Amber was the tomboy. You could not dress Amber. Amber dressed herself.

When she was old enough to walk, she dressed herself and it would be boots, shorts. Some stupid looking shirt and she didn't care. You were not going to change her and we had to go into public. She looked like an orphan, but you know what? That was my buddy. She followed me outside. She was by my side 24/7. She was outdoors. She was country. She was a spitting image of her Mama and she was a pistol.

Now, the negative side of all of it was she got my attitude, she got my rebellion, she got my I guess the negative side of me, even though she got the beauty of her mom, she got my my rebel side and she got a spanking just about every day from the age of 3 till I don't remember how I guess till the till the day she moved out. She was always in trouble. She always challenged in fact. Yeah, there there came a time when she was probably six or seven years old that her Mama couldn't spank her anymore, but ohh, Daddy could. It was amazing.

Raising those 2 girls was so rewarding. They were polar opposites. Blonde hair, blue eyed people pleaser never in trouble or never really strive to be in trouble to brunette brown eyes and didn't give a rats ass what you told her. She was going to do what she wanted, when she wanted, how she wanted and she would take the spanking. That kid did not care that she was going to be in trouble. She did. She still does today.

But they were, they were just but but they, they, they, they completed the family. They were amazing. And everything that I did was all for them.

Late in 2001, 2002, we were doing well. The business was doing great. I would tell people "it's like going to the office and printing money." He just millions and millions of dollars coming and going, just hands down. You got a little bit big in our britches. We bought a yacht, a 50 foot 1995 aft cabin Carver yacht and put it there in a Lake Texoma at Grand Pappy Marina.

And one of the things that probably was part of the downfall of that time was that we thought we were bigger than life. I did. I mean every Friday night we were hanging out up there Grand Pappys with Pete Verde who was the co-owner of Jason's Deli. Right across the street from us was Troy Aikman, quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys. Crossed the other way was Eddie Balfour, who at the time was the goalie of the Dallas Stars hockey team who had just won the Stanley Cup.

So we were stepping in high cotton with bigwigs and we played cards, we played poker, we hobnob, we take our hotel and tie up together and just was living high on the hog. I started at that time was when I really first started doing fixing flips. So we didn't know it was fixing flips at the time. Basically there were a lot of families that just couldn't afford a $250,000 brand new house, but they could afford $175,000 house.

So it started buying properties. Fixing them up and moving people into them as an owner, finance then working and then we would have 12 months to work on their credit, work on their finances and get them refinance so that the time clock wasn't as short and we made good money because we could buy it for $70,000, put $40,000 into it. So let's say I'm into it for $100,000, but I'd sell it for $130, making interest on $130 and then making the equity when we refinanced. So it was great and we had going into 2004, 2005, 2006, we had probably 30-40-50 houses under owner finance. And living life. Well, living life like there was no tomorrow. Living life like there was no end.

And then the financial crash happened 2008. The real estate market crashed over 252 banks, lenders that we were using. Close their doors went out of business. Countrywide, Bank of America, Lehman Brothers. Option one, I mean, you name it, every day we're getting a new report of lenders closing their doors, banks going out of business. And I had nowhere to go. It was a very, very dark time in our life. We lost it all. We lost it all. I mean, when it rains, it pours.

Around that time our beautiful house that we had just built a few years earlier, custom design, custom built. Right there on Angies, we bought some land from Angie's parents and built this massive house that was our dream home. Custom. Every square inch was custom. It caught on fire. Had burnt. We fought with the insurance company for a good year and a half trying to get replacement costs and stuff, trying to get our money out of it to be rebuilt it. That drained us emotionally, financially, physically. That was the beating of all beatings was fighting that.

We ended up selling that house, then the market crashes. I got nothing going in. Nothing. No, no money coming in. I didn't. I really, I honestly thought that it was the end of times, that Armageddon had happened. We started just selling houses for pennies on the dollar. Some people had was was close enough. I just gave them a house. We just walked away. I was beat down. I was burnt out. I was mad. The anger from from my childhood was coming back.

I was mad I hadn't really dealt with it because I had the girls, I had the kids, and I promised myself, I had promised God that I was going to be the best damn dad those girls would ever know. And I had suppressed all my anger with my dad. My father. I had suppressed all that and I had been over backwards to be a true hero to my girls. And now this, now this. This financial windfall that we had was being jerked out from underneath us. Hard and fast, like a tornado whipping through and just annihilating everything in its path. It was gone. It was over.

I stepped out. We sold everything. I sold the mortgage company. I sold the re/max franchise. I closed the doors on the title company. I I closed the doors on the appraisal company. I was out. I was done. It was unbelievable. And I didn't know what to do. Was lost. For 6-7 years. I just wondered, I sold insurance, I sold Aflac, I sold Colonial Life, I sold Health life auto. I thought, "you know, everybody needs insurance" and I thought everybody need homes, but if you can't get a mortgage, what are you going to do?

They put new restrictions on mortgage lending from the the Dodd Frank legislation because they believe that the lenders are the reason why the market crashed. I wasn't going to go back into that world. So I thought, "you know what, everybody needs insurance. Everybody needs health, cancer, life insurance. Let's sell that." And again, if I believed in it, I could sell it to anybody. I became one of the fastest growing sales agents in the area, breaking records left and right.

I went to work for Aflac. And within 60 days I became the number one seller in the region of the North Texas region, opening more cases, closing more policies than anybody in the region. Month after month after month, Every quarter they would have an awards banquet. And I'm not kidding you. I would get at least out of the 10/12/15 awards being handed out, I would get 85% of the awards. Most cases, most premium, most cancer policies, most life policies. It didn't matter if there was an award to be given. That was my target. That's what I went after.

But see you. I remember I read this book a long time ago, written by Zig Zigler and written by Napoleon Hill. That said, if you believe it, you can achieve it. If you just set your mind to it, understand the value of it, share the value of it, and do good by others, you will achieve success. And that's all I ever did. I knew the pains of cancer, I knew the heartaches of cancer, I knew the financial strains it put on families, and I was able to share my story and write policies. I didn't have to manipulate. I didn't have to be a hard closer. I just spoke to people, shared with them value.

I was the number one seller for about 3 years straight with Aflac and then I got a job promotion to go to work for Colonial Life to be the Vice President of the North Texas region which encompassed from Texarkana all the way over to New Mexico. That was my territory and when I took over that territory it was in last place. It was 32 territories in the nation under colonial life and the North Texas Dallas territory was in last place.

But guess what? They said that the top 2 territories by the end of the year. I'm in a trip to Hawaii. I never been to Hawaii. I've never been to Hawaii and guess what? By the end of the year the North Texas Territory was #1. We had built that up with the most cases, the most premium, the most recruits, the most districts and became #1 inside 11 1/2 months. And guess what? I was #1 the second year, and I was #1 the third year.

But here was the problem. I believed very hard in my religious stance. And I believed that I needed to share that message. But in corporate America, you can't do that. In the first time it really slapped me in the head was around Easter. I sent out a Mass e-mail. It was a Zig Ziglar quote, but it had an Easter reference or scripture, I can't remember in the quote and on. And that was on a Friday afternoon On Monday morning I got called by HR saying "don't ever do that again."

The other thing that I wasn't allowed to do was have prayer. I wanted my district managers to meet with me every morning at 8:00 on a conference call. We talked about the day, the week, whatever, but we started with a morning prayer wasn't allowed. So what we did? Was when we set up a conference call at 7:30 before anybody clocked in, I paid for the conference call and we had it and we had about 20 district managers and some sales managers on this call. And we had scripture and prayer for everybody involved, and they found out about that. And I got a second mark against me.

I had just about had enough. I hated the job. I wasn't able to be the leader that I knew I was. You couldn't. You couldn't do anything but be a robot, and that was not me. But I will tell you, I got a call right before I resigned from colonial Life. I had gotten a call. There was a district manager out in Longview, TX. Her name was Cherry Martin and she was a hard case. Lady Hard case. She didn't like me, she didn't want like me. She thought she was qualified for the job, she didn't get it and she wasn't about to take any orders from some snot nose Aflac guru.

Aflac and Colonial Life arrivals, they both sold the same product and they were, they were rivals. And here I come from Aflac over to run this territory for Colonial Life. She didn't like me and she didn't have any problems telling everybody she didn't like me. But her and I became really good friends. I had tolerated her. I had helped her build her district back up. And she was one of the ones that had requested the morning conference call and prayer.

This is when you know you have to do God's work no matter what. Right before I resigned. Cherry died of a massive heart attack. She was a heavy smoker. I think she'd gotten pneumonia or something and had gone into the hospital and he had a blood clot or something and died. But her parents called me and said, "hey, Mr. Potter, we wanted to tell you that, you know? I don't know if you know it, but about a month or two ago Cherry received Jesus Christ. As a personal savior. And she talked about you every day. She talked about how stern you were, but how strong you were in your faith and how you never wavered that you never you never compromised. And she loved that about you. And because of you, you led her back to Christ. She accepted Jesus Christ about a month ago and was baptized and you know."

This is why we do what we do, because we never know when we're going to make a difference. We never know when the opportunities will present itself. We must always be sharing who we are and what we do at all levels, not just for business. Been in our beliefs. Because one person now is in heaven. For all eternity because I stood my ground.

It was there. When I realized that being there was was no longer an option. I resigned from colonial life and I set out to start my own company. It was time for another chapter.

## Chapter 5: The Weight of All Things

The moment I held my acceptance letter into the United States Marine Corps Officer Candidate School, I felt like the man I always hoped I could be. It wasn't just a paper—it was a ticket out. Out of the grind, out of the mess, out of the shadow of doubt. That certificate symbolized a path to something real—embassy security, elite government service, even the CIA or Secret Service. I had clawed my way up through the chaos, and this was finally my reward.

It was early May, and I had two weeks left before school let out. I was already mentally preparing for the next phase: San Diego boot camp. Officer or not, I had to go through the same eight weeks of hell every recruit faces. I didn't mind. It felt like a rite of passage, one I welcomed with open arms.

And then the phone rang.

It was my stepbrother, Steve Mann. The words came slow, tight, like they were coated in concrete.

"It's your dad," he said. "Leukemia. And it's pretty severe."

The world stopped spinning.

Back in 1990, cancer didn't come with brochures and percentages. It was dark, confusing, and final. I had only ever known one person with it, and it ended badly. Leukemia? I didn't even understand it fully. I just knew it was bad.

The weight of that news hit like a hammer to the chest.

I called my Marine Corps recruiter. I laid out everything. He explained the facts: I wouldn't earn my commission until I completed both boot camp and my bachelor's degree. If I needed to delay, I could. But the train would leave without me for a while.

I hung up, my mind racing.

I had four brothers, all of them grown, married, building lives of their own. But me? I had this window—a moment in time to step up, not as a Marine, not as a student—but as a son.

And that was the moment I made one of the hardest decisions of my life.

I called my mom. Then my stepmom. I told them both the same thing: "I'm coming home. I'm putting the Marine Corps on hold. I'm putting school on hold. I'll help."

My stepmom had already been carrying a load no woman should ever carry alone. She worked full-time in the bakery at the local grocery store. She was already taking care of my father, running the house, and still managing the ranch. It was too much.

She didn't ask me for anything. But I knew she needed help.

So I packed my things. I walked away from the path I had finally carved for myself. I left behind the uniform I hadn't even earned yet.

And I went home—not as a hero, but as a son.

Because when family calls, you answer.

### The Grind Beneath the Surface

School finished up for the semester, and I loaded up every piece of the life I had planned and drove back to Stillwell. What waited for me wasn't a homecoming—it was a cold, hard reality check.

I sat down with my dad and stepmom, full of intention and maybe a little pride. I was there to help. I had chosen this over everything else—college, the Marines, the future I had fought for.

The first words out of my father's mouth?

"Well, great. But you're gonna have to get a job—there's no money here."

That was it. No "thank you." No "I'm proud of you for coming back." Just a demand. A reminder that love in that house came with a price tag.

Still, I kept my head down. I didn't come home for applause—I came for her. My stepmom had done everything—raised kids, managed the home, kept a job, and now was caretaker to a man crumbling under the weight of cancer.

She was the unsung hero. I wasn't going to let her carry that alone.

I landed a job at the local canned food plant. It was soul-draining but steady. My mornings started at 3:30 a.m., before the sun even considered rising. The ranch had been converted from a dairy farm to a rabbit operation—250 of them. Feeding, cleaning, sorting. Every third day, 50 does had to be bred by five bucks. Breeding rabbits wasn't simple—you had to move them, cage them, wait, monitor. It was routine, tedious, and unending.

Once the morning chores were done, I'd clock in at the cannery by 6:30. Eight hours in fluorescent lights and metallic clatter. Then home to bale hay across the 450-acre pasture, prep for the next day, and hope for a few hours of sleep.

If that wasn't enough, when Dad was away for chemo—which often meant two, three, sometimes four days in Fort Smith—I took on every last bit of ranch duty solo.

I was breaking my back and bleeding my soul dry for a man who could barely look me in the eyes.

I held onto hope. I hoped that maybe, just maybe, he'd see it. The sacrifice. The sweat. The burden I was carrying to ease his.

But the cracks only deepened.

We fought. Constantly. Loudly. Painfully.

He nitpicked everything. I wasn't feeding the rabbits correctly. I wasn't stacking the hay properly. I wasn't doing *enough.*

Nothing I did was ever good enough for him.

And the more I tried to please him, the more resentment grew. Not just from him—but inside me. I had come home hoping to repair something between us, to bridge that broken gap that had always kept us circling each other like enemies in the same trench.

But every day, that hope died a little more.

And I started to wonder if the very decision to come home hadn't just cost me my future—but my peace.

### The Goodbye That Never Came

I thought that maybe, just maybe, my coming home, my sacrifice, would heal something between us. I had hoped he'd see how hard I was working and that somehow, the walls would come down. That the war between us would end.

Instead, the fighting got worse.

One afternoon, I made the hour-long trip from the ranch to Fort Smith to visit him during one of his treatment stays. I was exhausted—physically, emotionally, spiritually. But I showed up, because that's what you do for the people you love, even if they don't love you back the way you need.

And like clockwork, we started fighting.

He wasn't even home—but the war followed us everywhere.

He raged about one of his cow dogs—she'd come into heat, and I'd missed it. Some stray had bred her and now we had mutts on the way.

That was it. That was the final straw for him. Not the cancer. Not the pain. Not the ticking clock.

The dog.

He came unglued. Yelling. Accusing. Berating.

And I snapped.

I stood up in that sterile hospital room and looked the man who had haunted me, shaped me, and crushed me straight in the face.

"You know what?" I said. "I'm done. I'm done trying to please you. Done trying to earn something you'll never give. I won't be back. Not here. Not like this."

And I walked out.

No hug. No handshake. No goodbye.

Just pain, heat, and silence.

Two days later, my stepmom called. Or maybe she came home—everything was a blur back then. The doctors were desperate. The cancer had dug in like barbed wire wrapping around his blood. His white blood cells were collapsing. He couldn't fight off the smallest infection. He was wasting away.

So they made one last gamble—a massive dose of chemo to kill every white blood cell, good and bad. Then, a bone marrow transplant. The hope was that clean, new cells would grow in their place.

It was a Hail Mary.

But what followed wasn't hope. It was stillness.

He slipped into a coma almost immediately.

And there I was—19 years old, wrecked, raw, and shattered. The last words I had said to my father were forged in anger. All I wanted now was one more chance. Five minutes. Two. Thirty seconds. A chance to say: *I'm sorry. I just wanted you to be proud of me. Just once.*

I did everything right. I showed up every day after work. I sat beside his bed in the sterile white of that hospital room, begging—pleading—with God, with fate, with anyone who'd listen.

Please… just let him wake up.

Just for a moment. Just long enough to hear me say: "You were my hero, even if you never knew it. I just wanted to be enough for you."

But that moment never came.

And on the eighth day, he passed away.

### The Storm Inside

On the eighth day, he passed away.

Just like that—without a goodbye, without a final look, without closure—he was gone.

And something inside me broke loose.

I left Fort Smith numb. Hollow. Like the life had been drained from my veins. But the pain wasn't soft—it was fire. A rage I couldn't name. And it needed somewhere to go.

On my drive back to the ranch, the universe served up a target.

Some punk kid in town who'd been mouthing off for weeks pulled up at a stoplight. He was the kind of loud-mouthed wannabe tough guy who thought he owned the streets. I didn't even think. My grief needed a release, and he just happened to be in the blast zone.

I pulled in behind him. Got out. He saw me. He got out too—tried to puff his chest.

Big mistake.

The fight wasn't fair. It wasn't controlled. It wasn't even about him.

I unloaded years of rage, of pain, of childhood fights and the echo of my dad's disappointment, all in one seven-minute explosion. Punches thrown like confessions. Kicks like prayers that would never be answered.

When it was done, he lay there—broken, bloodied, moaning.

And I? I just climbed back into my truck and drove off like a man walking away from a burning building he set himself.

Back at the ranch, everything felt dead. The silence, the shadows. My stepmom told the family she was selling it. Said it was time to move on. Time to be closer to work. Time to let go.

I couldn't argue.

For days, I drank like it was a religion. Sat in silence. Picked fights just to feel something. I was so damn angry—at my brothers, my stepmom, my life, God, and mostly at myself.

And then came the one voice I could never drown out. His voice.

*You'll never finish college. You'll never make it. You'll never be enough.*

### The Fire That Wouldn't Die

His voice.

That damn voice. Cold. Condemning. Etched into the inside of my skull.

*You'll never finish. You won't amount to anything. You'll quit, just like always.*

I could feel it in the pit of my stomach, like a hot coal that wouldn't go out. I heard him every time I looked in the mirror. I saw it in the eyes of people around town. I knew what they were thinking. That I was washed up. That I peaked in pain and collapsed in failure.

But I couldn't let that be the last chapter.

Not after all the hell I'd gone through. Not after all the pain I carried. Not after walking away from the Marines. Not after losing my dad.

So just after Thanksgiving, I made a decision that would change everything.

I packed up and drove to Tahlequah, to the campus of Northeastern State University. I walked in, sat down with a counselor, and laid it all out—transcripts from Edmond and NEO, grades, classes, life detours, all of it.

We built a plan.

I needed 31 more hours to graduate. That meant three full semesters: spring, summer, and fall. I didn't hesitate.

We signed the papers. Made it official. I was going back.

And I wasn't doing this for anyone else—not this time. Not for my dad. Not for my brothers. Not to prove anything to the world.

I was doing this for me.

That spring, I hit the ground running. Full course load. No excuses. When summer rolled around, while most were taking it easy or working part-time, I doubled down. Same with the fall.

Twelve months later—December 1991—I walked across that stage and earned my bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice, Pre-Law, and Political Science.

And with it, I reclaimed a piece of myself that had been buried under grief, anger, and doubt.

### Doors That Opened... and Slammed Shut

After completing my degree, something shifted inside me. A burden lifted. Not just because I had finished, but because I had *proven something*. To myself. To the ghost of my father. To every damn voice that ever said I couldn't do it.

I had become something real.

And then—just when I was figuring out my next move—life threw me a rope.

I had met a man in Stillwell named Bill Langley. A community leader. Politically connected. A man with pull. We'd become close, and he saw something in me—potential, grit, purpose.

One day, we sat down over coffee. "What's next for you?" he asked.

I told him straight: "I want in. CIA. Secret Service. Something that matters."

He didn't blink. "Let me make a call."

Turns out, Bill was tight with Oklahoma Senator David Boren—who had *just* been appointed Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. If anyone could crack open a door into the highest levels of service, it was him.

And he did.

The response was fast: there was a push to recruit new government agents. I had a shot. But there were hoops to jump through—a background check, followed by a national intelligence exam. Only the top 5% would make it.

I immediately called my old professor, Leon Manning, at NEO. I laid everything out. He gave me his full blessing. Told me my background was clean, my credentials solid.

I was in.

I received my official invitation to sit for the national exam. It was scheduled in two weeks. They told me to study up—world affairs, international politics, ambassadors, statecraft.

But I didn't take it seriously. Not enough.

College had come naturally. I'd never had to grind too hard. I figured I could walk in, lean on wit and instinct, and come out the other side with a ticket to Langley.

The day of the exam, I walked into a packed auditorium in Tulsa.

It was humbling. No—*it was terrifying*.

Everywhere I looked, there were men and women in crisp suits, clean resumes, degrees from elite schools. Most had master's degrees. Many had PhDs. They weren't just studying politics—they had lived it, breathed it.

I started talking to a few of them. Their backgrounds were intimidating. And I began to realize, within ten minutes, I was out of my depth.

They passed out the exam. 250 questions.

I opened the book and read the first page. Then the second. Then the third.

My heart sank.

These weren't questions—they were riddles written in languages I didn't speak. Who was the ambassador to Zimbabwe? What treaty was amended in 1984 in Estonia? What UN declaration clashed with which resolution in Southeast Asia?

I didn't know a single answer.

I stared at the page. And I knew.

I got up. I walked out.

When I got to my car, I called Bill. I thanked him. I told him I wasn't ready. And I apologized for wasting his favor.

He was disappointed—but respectful.

He didn't yell. He didn't scold. But I could feel the weight in his silence.

A few days later, Bill called again.

Another opportunity had surfaced. A friend of his—a sheriff down in Killeen, Texas—was hiring two new deputies. It was real. Tangible. A fresh start.

I jumped on it.

I called the department. A young woman answered. Her voice was familiar, but I brushed it off. Then I was transferred to the sheriff. We hit it off immediately—talked for almost an hour. Goals, leadership, brotherhood. It felt right.

Bill followed up. The deal was in motion. I'd go down the next week to sign papers, submit for a background check, and start a new life.

Two days later, Bill asked me to stop by his office.

I knew that tone. Something was off.

He looked at me with something between frustration and disbelief. "Do you remember that girl who answered the phone when you called Killeen?"

I nodded slowly.

He gave me her name. My stomach turned.

She was an ex-girlfriend from my time at UCO in Edmond. We hadn't ended well. She had withdrawn from school without warning. Rumors were, she'd had some kind of breakdown.

And now? She was the sheriff's right hand.

That door slammed shut before I could even step through it.

Bill leaned back in his chair. I stared at the wall. The past had caught up with me in the most brutal way.

Another opportunity lost. Not from failure. Not from lack of work ethic.

But from the ghosts I still hadn't outrun.

We poured a drink in silence.

The road ahead was unclear.

But I wasn't done.
