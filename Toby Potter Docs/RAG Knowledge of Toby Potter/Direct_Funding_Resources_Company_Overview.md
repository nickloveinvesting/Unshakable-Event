# DIRECT FUNDING RESOURCES
## Your Private Lending Partner for Real Estate Success

---

### **CEO MESSAGE: TOBY POTTER**

Listen up. I've been in this game long enough to know what separates winners from wannabes in real estate financing. After building, losing, and rebuilding a $500M+ portfolio, I didn't create Direct Funding Resources to be another cookie-cutter lender. We created it because real estate investors need a partner who gets it—someone who's been in the trenches, lost their ass, and came back stronger.

At Direct Funding Resources, we don't just write checks. We write success stories. Because when you win, we win. That's not corporate speak—that's battle-tested truth.

**—Toby Potter, CEO**

## **OUR DEAL EVALUATION PROCESS**

When Toby Potter built this company, he insisted we ask the hard questions that separate real deals from pipe dreams. Here's what we dig into:

### **MARKET REALITY CHECKS**
- "A $600K ARV in Garland? Show me 3 comparable sales in the last 6 months."
- Geographic price ceilings by specific submarkets
- School district impact on values
- Neighborhood gentrification limits

### **FINANCIAL SANITY VERIFICATION**  
- Rent-to-price ratio analysis
- Tenant demographic matching to rent levels
- Days on market reality for the area
- Competition analysis within 3-mile radius

### **EXPERIENCE DEPTH ASSESSMENT**
- Previous deal complexity vs. current project scope
- Timeline verification on claimed experience
- Market knowledge in specific areas
- Financial scaling readiness

We don't just rubber-stamp applications. We prevent disasters before they happen.
