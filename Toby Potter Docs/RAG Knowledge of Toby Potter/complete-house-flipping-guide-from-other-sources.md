## Getting Started: Foundation Principles {#getting-started}

### Core Concepts

**What is House Flipping?**
House flipping involves buying properties to sell for profit through two primary strategies:
- **Wholesaling**: Quick resale without major repairs, focusing on negotiation and speed
- **Rehabbing**: Buying distressed properties, renovating them, and selling for higher value

**The Golden Rules**
1. **You make your money when you buy, not when you sell** - Purchase price determines profit potential
2. **Location matters more than condition** - Better locations appreciate faster and hold value longer
3. **Time is money** - Every day you hold property costs money in carrying costs
4. **Don't fall in love with properties** - Stay objective and business-focused
5. **Always have an exit strategy** - Plan multiple ways to profit from each deal

### Market Reality Check

Flipping can be profitable in any market condition:
- **Down markets**: More distressed properties available at discounts
- **Up markets**: Properties sell faster, reducing holding costs
- **Key**: Focus on finding good deals regardless of overall market trends

**Realistic Expectations**
- Part-time flippers: $50,000-$100,000 annually
- Deal profits: $10,000-$100,000+ depending on market and strategy
- Tax implications: Profits taxed as business income, not capital gains
- Time commitment: 20+ hours per deal minimum

## Finding Properties and Deals {#finding-properties}

### The Acquisition Strategy Matrix

**Primary Sources for Deals:**

#### 1. Distressed Homeowners
- **Pre-foreclosure properties**: Contact homeowners facing foreclosure
- **Motivated sellers**: Divorce, death, job loss, medical bills, relocation
- **Marketing methods**: Direct mail, door knocking, online advertising
- **Advantages**: Can inspect property, negotiate directly, win-win solutions
- **Best for**: Investors comfortable with personal interaction

#### 2. Foreclosure Auctions
- **Process**: Properties sold on courthouse steps to highest bidder
- **Requirements**: Cash or certified funds, no financing contingencies
- **Research**: Review foreclosure notices, drive by properties, estimate values
- **Risks**: Buying sight unseen, existing liens, eviction issues
- **Best for**: Experienced investors with cash reserves

#### 3. REO Properties (Bank-Owned)
- **What they are**: Properties banks acquired through foreclosure
- **Where to find**: Directly from lenders' asset management departments
- **Advantages**: Can inspect thoroughly, clear title, motivated sellers
- **Negotiation**: Banks want to liquidate quickly, often accept below-market offers
- **Best for**: Investors wanting to inspect before purchase

#### 4. MLS and Real Estate Agents
- **Short sales**: Properties worth less than mortgage balance
- **Distressed listings**: Properties priced to sell quickly
- **REO listings**: Bank-owned properties listed by agents
- **Advantages**: Professional support, financing options, legal protection
- **Best for**: Beginning investors, those needing financing

### The 100 House Rule

Before making offers, new investors should:
- Look at 100+ properties to understand condition-value relationships
- Study neighborhood comps and pricing trends
- Practice estimating repair costs
- Build relationships with agents and contractors

### Direct Marketing Strategies

**Direct Mail Campaign Setup:**
1. **Target Lists**: Pre-foreclosure, absentee owners, tired landlords
2. **Messaging**: Professional, helpful tone focusing on solving problems
3. **Follow-up**: Multiple touches over time, most responses come later
4. **Response Management**: Professional phone system, quick callbacks

**Door Knocking Guidelines:**
- Research properties and owners first
- Professional appearance and approach
- Focus on helping solve problems, not just buying cheap
- Follow local solicitation laws
- Safety first - work in teams when possible
