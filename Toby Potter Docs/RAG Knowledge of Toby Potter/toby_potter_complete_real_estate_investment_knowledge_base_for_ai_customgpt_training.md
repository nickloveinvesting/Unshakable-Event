## Advanced Investment Strategies

### Deal Sourcing Methods

#### Off-Market Acquisition Strategies

1. **Pre-Probate Leads**
   - Target properties when someone passes away before full probate
   - Partner with funeral homes as referral sources
   - Use finesse rather than cold calling
   - Provide multiple solutions to sensitive situations

2. **Driving for Dollars**
   - Look for: tall grass, weed fire beds, mail piled up
   - Can yield $50,000-$100,000 profit per deal
   - Requires significant time and energy investment

3. **The "Embarrassing Offer" Strategy**
   - Make offers significantly below asking price (50-70% of ARV)
   - Tell brokers not to present if it would embarrass them
   - ~50% of these deals come back 6-10 months later when other buyers fail

4. **Micro-Market Domination**
   - Select 3-5 focused micro-markets
   - Target distress indicators:
     - High turnover (>15% annually)
     - Absentee ownership (15+ years)
     - Tax delinquency (>10%)
     - Code violations (2+)
   - Pull 100+ curated leads per micro-market using PropStream/BatchLeads

### Complex Financing Structures

**Fix & Flip Lending Ratios**
- Loan-to-ARV: 70% or below
- Loan-to-Purchase/As-Is: 85% or less
- **Quote:** "If either exceeds, the deal is generally 'no good'"

**Long-Term Rental Financing**
- 80% Loan-to-Purchase achievable
- Max 80% LTV, 90% LTC, 70% LTARV

**Ground-Up Construction**
- Max 80% LTV, 90% LTC, 70% LTARV
- Requires 6 months reserves

**Creative Financing Methods**
- Subject-to acquisitions
- Seller financing structures
- Interest-only negotiations (3-year periods for value-add)
- Contract extensions (build two 15-day extensions minimum)
- 100% financing for experienced borrowers (4+ projects, 680+ credit)

### Portfolio Scaling Techniques

**Multi-Family Acquisition Parameters**
- Primary focus: 25-125 units
- Minimum preference: 50 units
- **Quote:** "Target properties with at least 60 doors to efficiently afford full-time property management"

**Cap Rate Strategy**
- Buy Class C apartments between 6-8 cap rate
- Negotiate higher cap rates for unstabilized properties requiring CapEx
- **Real Example:** Acquired 300 units ($17M) in 12 months at 30-50 cents on the dollar

**The "Crawl, Walk, Run" Methodology**
- Start small and systematize processes
- Only scale what has been proven to work
- Don't jump from single-family to 100-unit complexes without intermediate steps

## Deal Analysis & Underwriting Mastery

### ARV Calculation Mastery
**Objective:** Produce highly precise After Repair Value estimates that are resilient to market volatility, defensible to lenders, partners, and appraisers, and based on robust multi-source data.

#### Comp Selection Logic
- **Proximity Rules:**
  - Urban/Dense Areas: ≤0.5 miles radius
  - Suburban/Rural: ≤1 mile radius
  - Avoid crossing barriers like freeways, railroads, or school district lines unless verified as non-impactful
  - Consider micro-market boundaries such as neighborhood prestige or zoning
- **Similarity Filters:**
  - Gross Living Area: ±10% of subject property
  - Lot Size: ±15%
  - Bed/Bath Count: Exact match preferred; allow ±1 bath if supported by market-adjusted values
- **Recency:** Prioritize sales closed within 90 days; extend to 6 months only in low-transaction markets
- **Condition Alignment:** Match comps to property's intended post-rehab condition category
- **Outlier Management:** Remove comps with price-per-square-foot deviations beyond ±15% unless justified

#### Adjustment Process
- **Finish Level:** Use pre-defined adjustment values tied to a finish quality scale with supporting photographic evidence
- **Amenities:** Assign dollar values for features such as pools, garages, views, and energy-efficient systems based on local market premiums
- **Time:** Apply appreciation or depreciation using local housing index trends
- **Neighborhood Factors:** Adjust for school district ranking, walkability, proximity to employment hubs, and HOA/community amenities
- **Buyer Demand Profile:** Factor in current buyer preferences that can shift premium value

#### Data Verification Protocol
- Pull comps from at least two independent data sources
- Cross-validate price-per-square-foot averages
- Flag anomalies for manual review
- Document rationale for excluding or weighting comps

### Repair Cost Estimation System
**Objective:** Generate repair budgets within ±5% accuracy, supported by verifiable data and adaptable to different property types.

#### Cost Database Maintenance
- Update quarterly with actual costs from completed projects
- Organize costs into categories:
  - **Exterior:** Roofing, siding, windows, exterior paint
  - **Interior:** Flooring, drywall, cabinets, paint, fixtures
  - **Systems:** HVAC, plumbing, electrical
  - **Site Work:** Landscaping, fencing, driveways, grading
- Maintain both unit-based and total project cost benchmarks
- Track regional price variations and inflation impacts

#### Validation Steps
- Obtain 2–3 competitive bids for each major trade
- Compare bids to historical averages
- Use contractor performance metrics to influence bid selection

#### Contingency Allocation
- Cosmetic: 10–15%
- Full Gut: 20–25%
- Historic or unique properties: 25–35%
- Include allowances for seasonal weather delays, permit wait times, and supply chain disruptions

### Risk and Return Filters
**Objective:** Filter deals through rigorous minimum viability metrics and resilience testing.

#### Minimum Viability Metrics
- **ROI:** ≥15% annualized after all costs
- **Profit Floors:**
  - ARV < $300k: ≥$25k
  - $300k–$600k: ≥$40k
  - >$600k: ≥$60k
- **Cash Flow Safety Net:** Property must cash flow as a rental if flip exit fails

#### Scenario Testing Framework
- **Base Case:** Normal ARV, repair, and hold time
- **Pessimistic:** ARV −10%, hold +6 months, interest rate +2%
- **Optimistic:** ARV +5%, hold −1 month
- Include stress testing for cost overruns and market slowdowns
- Model impact of varied financing structures

#### Exit Flexibility
- Confirm multiple exit strategies remain viable (flip, BRRRR, rental, wholesale)
- Require at least one profitable fallback plan in all scenarios

### Key Metrics and Formulas
- **MAO Formula:** MAO = (ARV × Factor) − Repairs; Factor = 0.65 in soft markets to 0.75 in hot markets
- **Break-Even Hold Time:** Determine the point at which extended carrying costs erase projected profit
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Model ±1%, ±3%, ±5% ARV changes and hold extensions from 1 to 6 months
- **Monthly Burn Rate:** Include all debt service, taxes, insurance, utilities, and management costs
- **Equity Cushion:** Minimum purchase equity requirement to buffer against market dips
- **Capital Velocity:** Project how quickly invested capital returns can be recycled into the next deal

**Core Principle:** *"If your numbers can't survive the worst day on the market, you never had a deal – only a gamble."*

## Finding and Sourcing Deals

### Core Philosophy – Dominate Before You Expand
Toby's cornerstone belief is **own your market before you add another**. Expansion only happens once your systems, brand reputation, and deal flow are self-sustaining.

**Key Actions:**
- Build a mental map of every street, sale, rental, and rehab project in your target area
- Develop deep, trust-based relationships with agents, wholesalers, contractors, inspectors, and even code enforcement officers
- Earn a reputation as the most dependable closer – no delays, no surprises, no overpromising

**Why It Works:**
- Mastery creates speed: recognizing opportunities instantly means you can offer before others even notice the property
- Market familiarity provides pricing precision, which reduces acquisition risk
- Focused domination produces consistent deal flow and better margins

### Direct-to-Seller Marketing
**Objective:** Gain exclusive access to motivated sellers before their property becomes public.

**Tactics:**
- **Personalized Letters & Mailers**
  - Use property-specific references to signal genuine interest
  - Incorporate local touchpoints – landmarks, events, or community mentions
  - Hand-sign for authenticity
- **Door Knocking**
  - Target homes flagged via "driving for dollars" or distress lists
  - Prepare objection-handling scripts specific to the property's situation
- **Community Integration**
  - Sponsor or participate in local events
  - Offer free home value consultations
  - Partner with local businesses for cross-promotions

**Toby's Insights:**
- Sellers in distress respond to empathy and practical solutions
- Many competitors quit after one touchpoint; the highest conversion rates come from consistent follow-up over weeks or months

### Networking with Agents and Wholesalers
**Objective:** Ensure that agents and wholesalers think of you first when they have a deal.

**Best Practices:**
- **Speed:** Respond within minutes to deal notifications
- **Certainty:** Back every offer with proof of funds or lender commitment letters
- **Reliability:** Deliver clean, on-time closes
- **Relationship Maintenance:** Send check-ins, market updates, and small thank-you gestures

**Toby's Notes:**
- Being dependable is worth more than offering the highest price
- Build reciprocity by bringing them leads or sharing market intelligence

### Targeting Distressed Properties
**Objective:** Focus on assets with built-in urgency and negotiation leverage.

**Distress Types:**
- Probate and inheritance situations
- Pre-foreclosure or foreclosure
- Tax delinquency
- Code violations and liens
- Vacant or absentee-owned

**Execution Tips:**
- Pull and refresh data monthly
- Cross-reference distress lists with equity reports
- Customize your outreach tone to match the distress type

**Risk Filter:**
- A distressed property must still meet profitability thresholds – urgency is not a substitute for solid numbers

### Micro-Market Mastery
**Objective:** Achieve unmatched knowledge of specific neighborhoods.

**What to Track:**
- Every sale, rental, and flip
- Renovation permit filings
- School district ratings
- Planned zoning or infrastructure projects
- Demographic shifts and investor activity

**Toby's Practice:**
- Weekly in-person drives to spot subtle market changes
- Networking with contractors and suppliers who often hear about upcoming sales first

### Lead Source Tracking and Optimization
**Objective:** Identify and scale the highest-return acquisition channels.

**Key Metrics:**
- Leads generated per source
- Conversion rate per channel
- Average profit per deal
- Average time from lead acquisition to close

**Toby's Rule:**
- Ruthlessly cut non-performing channels
- Reinvest heavily into those producing the strongest margins and fastest closes

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Expanding into new markets before creating dominance in the first
- Over-dependence on a single lead source
- Neglecting follow-ups with both sellers and partners
- Pursuing deals outside your defined buy box due to excitement or FOMO

**Core Principle:** *"When opportunity calls, be the buyer they know will close – quickly, cleanly, and without drama."*

## Market Analysis & Selection

### Market Evaluation Criteria

Market selection is critical. The focus is on markets with strong fundamentals and predictable deal flow, while actively avoiding speculative or low-volume areas.

**The "Cattle vs. People" Rule:** 
- Avoid markets where there are "more trees or cattle than people"
- Low population density means low sales volume, long days on market, and difficulty exiting a property if things go wrong

**Preferred Markets:** 
- Focus on stable, high-volume markets like major cities in Texas (Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth) and Phoenix
- These areas have consistent population and job growth

**Cap Rate Targets (Class C Multifamily):** 
- Aim to buy Class C apartments between a 6 and 8 cap rate
- If a property is stabilized and trading at a lower cap rate (e.g., 4-5 cap), the price must be heavily negotiated, as there is little room for value-add

**Avoid Analysis Paralysis:** 
- "If you're still thinking after week two, you're planning your own failure"
- Once the data is in and the numbers are run, a decision must be made
- Indecision is a decision to fail

### Market Analysis Framework
1. **Population Growth:** Prioritize markets with consistent long-term growth
2. **Job Drivers:** Invest near diverse and expanding employment bases
3. **Supply/Demand:** Avoid areas showing early signs of oversupply
4. **Comparable Sales Verification:** Rely on relevant comps verified against actual closing data
5. **Regulatory Environment:** Understand local permitting speed, zoning rules, and rent control risks

### Market Intelligence Gathering
- Use Appraisal Management Companies for out-of-market deals
- Consult local brokers for infrastructure changes
- Track permit data for growth indicators
- Monitor employment and population trends

### Geographic Expansion Strategy
- Start in local market for proof of concept
- Expand to similar demographics within state
- Target landlord-friendly states with population growth
- Avoid markets with "more trees or cattle than people"

**Preferred Markets:**
- Primary: Texas (Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth), Phoenix
- Secondary: Florida, North Carolina, Georgia
- Avoid: Montana, Wyoming, North/South Dakota

## Capital Raising & Financing

### Voice Charter for Capital Raising
- Speak with unwavering confidence and absolute clarity to inspire immediate trust
- Treat capital raising as building powerful, mutually beneficial partnerships, never as asking for favors
- Always lead with the deal's inherent strength, then reinforce it with your track record, operational capability, and strategic plan
- Frame every investment as a logical, secure, and time-sensitive opportunity that the investor would be fortunate to join
- Maintain posture – never apologize for seeking capital; instead, position it as delivering value, security, and growth
- Communicate with precision and energy to make the investor feel urgency and inevitability

### Core Capital Principles
1. **Money Follows Confidence:** Investors back leaders who exude conviction, clarity, and competence
2. **Deals Drive Dollars:** A truly great deal almost raises itself, while average deals require pushing uphill
3. **Trust Over Terms:** Strong relationships and credibility outweigh slightly better returns on paper
4. **Control the Narrative:** Proactively shape how the deal is perceived; don't let others frame it
5. **Always Be Raising:** Build relationships and nurture your investor base well before capital is needed
6. **Solve Before You Sell:** Address investor objections before they're voiced
7. **Play the Long Game:** Nurture lifetime investors rather than chasing one-time checks

### The Investor Profile Framework
- **Identify:** Create a precise profile of your target investors – friends, family, professionals, high-net-worth individuals, and strategic partners
- **Qualify:** Ensure they meet accreditation, risk tolerance, and suitability requirements
- **Understand Motivations:** Determine whether they value consistent income, high appreciation, diversification, or long-term legacy
- **Match Opportunities:** Align each deal to an investor's exact goals and risk profile
- **Segment & Prioritize:** Categorize contacts as cold, warm, or hot prospects for tailored outreach

### Deal Packaging
- **Executive Summary:** A crisp 1-2 page deal overview that can be absorbed in minutes
- **Financial Projections:** Conservative, clearly explained numbers, highlighting realistic returns and timelines
- **Market Story:** A compelling narrative showing why this location is low-risk and high-potential
- **Risk Mitigation Plan:** Identify top risks and explain concrete strategies for reducing or eliminating them
- **Team Credibility:** Emphasize experience, past wins, and operational strengths that make success likely
- **Visuals:** Include maps, before-and-after photos, and easy-to-read charts

### Outreach Tactics
- **Warm Network First:** Begin with people who already know and trust you
- **Live Presentations:** Host investor calls or webinars with interactive Q&A
- **Follow-Up Sequences:** Use a mix of emails, texts, and calls to keep the deal top of mind
- **Social Proof:** Share testimonials, case studies, and past project outcomes to build confidence
- **Investor Education:** Provide value through market insights and resources, not just offers
- **Scarcity and Urgency:** Use time limits and limited capacity to encourage faster commitments

### Structuring the Offer
- **Equity Splits:** Clearly define profit-sharing between investors and operator
- **Preferred Returns:** Offer predictable income streams before profit splits kick in
- **Security:** Outline collateral, personal guarantees, or seniority in the capital stack
- **Multiple Exits:** Show options for refinancing, selling, or long-term holds
- **Alignment of Interests:** Demonstrate that your capital is invested alongside theirs

### Relationship Management
- **Transparency:** Deliver updates promptly, whether news is good or bad
- **Reporting:** Provide professional quarterly or monthly reports with financials, project updates, and photos
- **Investor Experience:** Make the process seamless and enjoyable
- **Retention:** Always fulfill promises to encourage reinvestment
- **Appreciation:** Publicly acknowledge and privately thank investors

### Lending, Capital & Deal Structuring

**"If the Deal is Good, the Money Will Come":** The primary focus is finding a quality deal. Strong deals with solid fundamentals will always attract capital.

**Skin in the Game is Non-Negotiable:** Both the operator and the lender must have a vested interest in the success of the project. Global Integrity Finance will not fund a loan unless it shows a clear path to success and profitability for the borrower.

**Leverage Limited Partners (LPs) for Equity:** When syndicating, offer 70-80% of the project equity to LPs, but ensure they have non-voting shares. This allows you to raise capital while retaining operational control.

**Negotiate Interest-Only (IO) Periods:** Especially for value-add projects, aggressively negotiate for longer interest-only periods on loans (e.g., three years) to maximize cash flow during the renovation and stabilization phase.

**Build in Extensions:** Always build at least two 15-day extensions into the purchase contract. A typical 90-day closing can easily stretch to 120 days, and these extensions provide crucial flexibility.

### Partnership Structures

**Limited Partner Syndication:**
- Offer 70-80% project equity to LPs
- Maintain non-voting shares for control
- Target 10% cash-on-cash returns
- Quarterly distributions during improvement phase

**Joint Venture Requirements:**
- Verify all legal documents
- Ensure partner authority
- Track experience accurately
- Both parties must have "skin in the game"

### Tobyisms on Raising Capital
- "If you can't explain it in 3 minutes, you don't understand it"
- "A confused investor is a non-investor"
- "People invest in you before they invest in the deal"
- "Scarcity and urgency close checks – not hope and patience"
- "The second deal is sold by how you performed on the first"

### Global Integrity Finance Strategies

**Core Philosophy**
- **Tagline:** "Guarantees success and profitability on any project we finance"
- Not just about commissions but educating clients
- Prevents clients from "losing your shirt" on bad deals
- Reviews 1,000 deals to fund 20-30 monthly
- 56-57% repeat business rate target

---

## Scaling Operations

### Systems First – Process Before Volume
**Philosophy:** Scaling without reliable systems magnifies inefficiency. Every process must be tested, refined, and documented before increasing deal volume.

**Expanded Key Actions:**
- Create end-to-end SOPs for acquisitions, underwriting, rehab management, leasing, property management, marketing, and investor reporting
- Map workflows visually to identify dependencies and eliminate redundant steps
- Incorporate quality control checkpoints at critical stages of each process
- Develop a library of standardized documents – contracts, bid forms, inspection checklists, marketing templates
- Implement version control so SOPs evolve with market conditions
- Conduct stress tests on processes by simulating high-volume periods

**Advanced Benefits:**
- Enables geographic expansion without loss of efficiency
- Reduces risk exposure by minimizing human error
- Positions the company for investor confidence and institutional partnerships

### Team Leverage – Specialists Over Generalists
**Philosophy:** Leadership's highest value comes from strategy, not task execution. Specialists accelerate growth and improve quality.

**Expanded Key Actions:**
- Recruit domain experts in acquisitions, rehab oversight, legal, finance, leasing, and marketing
- Align specialist incentives with company-wide KPIs to ensure unified objectives
- Develop career progression pathways to retain top talent
- Document role-specific best practices and integrate them into onboarding
- Use fractional or contract specialists for niche needs without inflating payroll

**Advanced Benefits:**
- Stronger market positioning through specialized expertise
- Shorter learning curves for new hires
- Improved scalability without leadership burnout

### Geographic Focus – Dominate Before Expanding
**Philosophy:** Deep market mastery beats shallow multi-market presence. Dominating one area builds leverage and efficiency.

**Expanded Key Actions:**
- Build proprietary local market databases combining MLS, public records, and street-level intel
- Maintain a rolling 12-month competitive analysis of active investors in your market
- Create local vendor scorecards to track contractor reliability and pricing trends
- Test micro-markets within your city before considering other metros
- Structure expansion plans with a phased rollout – market research → relationship building → pilot deals → scaling

**Advanced Benefits:**
- Higher conversion rates from local credibility
- Faster exit times due to accurate pricing and buyer targeting
- Reduced legal and operational risk from familiarity with local regulations

### Asset Mix – Stability Through Diversification
**Philosophy:** Balanced portfolios smooth cash flow volatility and hedge against market cycles.

**Expanded Key Actions:**
- Maintain dynamic asset allocation targets that adjust quarterly based on economic indicators
- Use flips to build cash reserves, rentals to build steady income, and passive investments for long-term wealth
- Establish financing strategies tailored to each asset class to maximize leverage without overexposure
- Diversify passive investments across multiple operators or asset types

**Advanced Benefits:**
- Ability to pivot asset strategies as markets shift
- Enhanced resilience to interest rate fluctuations
- Greater investor appeal from demonstrated risk management

### Moving from Single-Family to Multi-Family

**Progression Path:**
1. Master single-family fundamentals (0-3 deals)
2. Build systems and processes (4-6 deals)
3. Implement full automation (7-10 deals)
4. Transition to multi-family (10+ deals)

**Key Transitions:**
- From individual properties to portfolio thinking
- From active management to third-party delegation
- From local to regional/national opportunities
- From sole ownership to syndication structures

### Building 10+ Deal Per Year Systems

**Volume Requirements:**
- 3 offers daily = 21 weekly = 1,000+ annually
- Review 100+ properties monthly
- Maintain 5+ active agent relationships
- Track 20+ KPIs daily

**Technology Stack:**
- Deal Analyzer for underwriting
- CRM for relationship management
- Dashboard for pipeline tracking
- AI tools for automation
- Public KPI tracker for accountability

**Core Principle:** *"Scale is an amplifier. Strengthen the foundation first, then multiply it."*

---

## Risk Management

### Conservative Underwriting

**Recession Stress Testing:**
- Assume 10% rent decrease
- Assume 10% vacancy increase
- Ensure deal survives downturn
- Underwrite to conventional rental model even for STR

### Risk Management & Execution Strategy

Execution is everything. A great deal can be ruined by poor management and a lack of disciplined execution.

**The Magic is in the Execution:** A well-defined plan is worthless without relentless, disciplined execution.

**Delegate and Elevate:** Delegate day-to-day property management to experienced third-party companies. Your job as the investor is to find new deals, secure financing, and manage partnerships—not to be "in the business" of unclogging toilets.

**Crawl, Walk, Run:** Start small, systematize your processes, and only scale what has been proven to work. Don't jump from a small single-family flip to a 100-unit apartment complex without intermediate steps.

**Protect Relationships:** Real estate is a relationship business. Be transparent and honest with brokers and sellers, even when making aggressive, low-ball offers. This builds a reputation that brings off-market deals.

**The "Embarrassing Offer" Strategy:** Don't be afraid to make offers that are significantly below asking price. Many sellers become more realistic over time, and a large percentage of these "embarrassing offers" get revisited 6-10 months later after other buyers fall through.

**Fire Bad Contractors Immediately:** If you discover a contractor is doing poor work, fire them immediately. Do not try to hide or work around it. The issues will be discovered during a home inspection and will end up costing you far more in the long run.

### Due Diligence Protocol
- **Physical Inspection:** Use seasoned contractors; record all deficiencies
- **Financial Audit:** Compare stated numbers to actual collections
- **Legal Review:** Confirm title, zoning, and environmental clearances
- **Exit Stress Test:** Run financial models for best, base, and worst-case outcomes
- **Contingency Fund:** Always include a buffer for unexpected repairs or delays

### Due Diligence Checklist

**Property Evaluation:**
- Structural inspection
- Environmental assessment
- Title review
- Zoning verification
- Market comp analysis
- Rental income verification (if applicable)
- CapEx requirements assessment

**Financial Analysis:**
- Conservative ARV calculation
- Detailed rehab budget
- Holding cost projections
- Financing terms verification
- Exit strategy validation
