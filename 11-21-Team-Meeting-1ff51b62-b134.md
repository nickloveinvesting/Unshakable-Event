# 11.21 Team Meeting

**Meeting Date:** 21st Nov, 2025 - 8:00 AM

---

**Toby Potter** *[00:01]*: Finally, we've arrived. It's been a long summer trying to get everything implemented and put into place, but as we have now landed into our new office suite, I like what we're looking at. The thing that we're going to talk about this morning is being able to orchestrate and articulate the product and the program. We have an event coming up February 12th. Okay. This will be our first live event. We have a multitude of intermediate events that will be on stage, but this will be our host event. And so one of the things that I want to discuss and talk about is how we. So we have the event in February, but we are starting in two weeks or maybe even sooner, doing webinars. Okay. And in that webinar is this platform and program that I want to talk about, the flagship offerings. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:25]*: As we roll out the coaching program, as we roll out the Unshakable Investor, The category of one is more aligned with the Unshakable Empire Architect. And what that basically alludes to is that we are designing and creating programs to stabilize individuals through their business, through their personal, regardless of what resistance that they're facing, whether it be, you know, marriage, relationships, sales, growing their business, growing their careers, whatever it is. The Unshakable Architect is a design platform to customize and specialize in that. So one of the things that as we're promoting the event, we want to do two things. One is bundle a package, but also in that those individuals now become spokespersons for us. And as a spokesperson, the core component is. Becoming a sponsor. So Randy signs up for the Unshakable Empire sponsorship bundle. 
**Toby Potter** *[02:59]*: Within that, he gets 10 tickets to the event and gives. Or he gives 11 tickets, he gives 10 of those tickets away. So when he bundles up and buys a program for $5,000 or whatever, part of that is 10 tickets for him to donate and give to 10 other people to be at the event. 
**Nick Love** *[03:26]*: So ideally, like a business owner and 10 of his employees or something. 
**Toby Potter** *[03:31]*: Yep, exactly. And those 10 people get a minimal package in this person. So Randy would be able to get, of course, you know, accolades. His business is going to be sponsored in the event as a donor. He gets a full package of this that we've laid out here on Strategizing and Structuring his business. So this is high level, mapped out. What we need to do now is fine tune this into a value added program package. And this is kind of what we are highlighted throughout this deal. 
**Angie Potter** *[04:21]*: So as a sponsor, they would get certain things and qualify for certain things in the 10 that they sponsored are in a different category. 
**Toby Potter** *[04:31]*: That's correct. They get a very small taste of the opportunity because like what Nick just alluded to is if they're a business owner. So if Randy's a business owner, he's got 10, 15 employees and he picks his top sales or top multi mid level manager, whatever they come in. Well, there's not much we can do for them but help now build Randy's business within that through different coaching and all that. So we really want to treat Randy's packets differently than we would Nick who has just buddies and so his buddies, our other business owners or other whatever his 10 people are going to get a different. 
**Angie Potter** *[05:13]*: Those 10 have the opportunity to upgrade. 
**Toby Potter** *[05:16]*: That's correct. 
**Angie Potter** *[05:17]*: At a distance and I mean if. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[05:18]*: You'Re an individual, you could lower your cost. I could charge you 250 for your ticket and your minimal. 
**Toby Potter** *[05:25]*: What do you mean? 
**Rachelle Davis** *[05:26]*: Like If I have 10 tickets and I wanted to not have to pay the full 5,000 myself. If you pay 250 to me and you got your seat with minimal. But so you could decide if you want to increase, then I've lowered my own cost. So they could bundle it with their. 
**Toby Potter** *[05:42]*: Yeah, that's correct. 
**Angie Potter** *[05:43]*: Correct. What is that? 
**Toby Potter** *[05:44]*: It's the elevator. So I'm going to go closer to. 
**Nick Love** *[05:47]*: I can get it. 
**Toby Potter** *[05:48]*: Okay, so we have. So we'll just kind of go through this real quick and talk out loud. So you have the flagship offer, the Untakable Empire sponsorship bundle, sponsoring 10 lives, rebuilding your own. We're looking at a say a $5,000 package, give or take. The core components would be the pillar of the bundle. So it's a 12 month program for the IGN. They're going to get a 30 day overview crash course of. Not really a crash course, but kind of an introductory course of. Phase two of that was for the next six months personal building the standards, their boundaries, time blocking kind of building a ritual, a daily discipline of rituals. Phase three of that going in from the month five to month eight, really understanding the income infrastructure strategies and understanding to what their goals are, what they need to achieve. 
**Toby Potter** *[06:56]*: So this is that big pillar and then you have the last 90 days basically stacking up the assets, stacking up the workflow and building and designing an overall culture and core values for the individual and or business. Along with that becomes a the Empire Integrity Playbook which is a physical binder, a physical workbook just like we did with the Unshakable shepherd creating, establishing a binder workbook to work through for mind identity, movement Standards, money, cash flow. And we labeled real estate foundation, but business foundations because this is what. We cannot pigeonhole this into real estate. This will need to be the business foundation that operates under a true philosophy of how to grow and build a business. That is a cookie cut boilerplate for all business foundations. 
**Nick Love** *[07:58]*: Yeah, I mean you also specified sales in there, but that's not a specific category. 
**Toby Potter** *[08:04]*: Maybe we should have a section for that sales. 
**Nick Love** *[08:07]*: It may go under the business, but I feel like you should do a separate. 
**Toby Potter** *[08:12]*: Right, that should be a separate category. So if Randy had his employees and he has and they're salespeople, then from that we would then pitch to Randy a add an add on product that we'd come in and do a sales training, a four hour sales training. 
**Nick Love** *[08:27]*: Not in the playbook, not in this. 
**Toby Potter** *[08:30]*: Because maybe Nick has mid level managers and he needs his managers to better communicators. He needs them to become better leaders. So we come and do a two to four hour course to Nick's group. So we have another byproduct on that. So we can then from. Once we land them into this, we have those additionals that they can add. Because this is a baseline $5,000 deal. This is just to get them in the door, to get them understanding and creating. 
**Nick Love** *[08:59]*: Yeah. So this, you know, the sponsor, they're getting everything pretty much that's listed in here. 
**Toby Potter** *[09:04]*: That's correct. Yeah, that's correct. 
**Angie Potter** *[09:05]*: So hang on, let me. 
**Toby Potter** *[09:08]*: Sorry. Okay. 
**Angie Potter** *[09:09]*: The year program is $5,000. Seems cheap. 
**Toby Potter** *[09:15]*: It is. 
**Angie Potter** *[09:15]*: It's an introductory because not. That doesn't really. That 5,000 doesn't really cover it because you sponsored 10 other people. And what of this do they do? 
**Toby Potter** *[09:28]*: You'll get to it. Okay, we'll get to it. 
**Nick Love** *[09:30]*: Yeah, I was gonna say that. 
**Toby Potter** *[09:33]*: And maybe that price point's not right, but this is, this is what we're discussing. 
**Angie Potter** *[09:38]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[09:38]*: Okay. 
**Nick Love** *[09:40]*: The guy who buys the 10 tickets, you know, I guess that guy would probably use all the programming bundles too, but he might be five steps ahead of the 10 people that's in it. That's correct. I guess. So it's made really more so for the guy to buy the sponsorship for those 10 people and they go through it. Not really. That guy. Maybe. 
**Toby Potter** *[10:04]*: So. No. So the concept is. So this is, the concept is. And this is what. This is all based upon the best I could do from what Alex Hermosi just did. This is all based upon how he bundled when talking to Jason Blojo. He said it was. 
**Nick Love** *[10:25]*: Yeah, I didn't know his products. 
**Toby Potter** *[10:26]*: Yeah, it was all a foundation of bundling, valuation, selling to the masses and then upselling to the individual. 
**Nick Love** *[10:34]*: Yep, yep. 
**Toby Potter** *[10:35]*: So you got Randy, you got, you got, we get 200, we get 300, we have 400 people that do this. But then it's all about the upsell. Yeah. Your add ons. Because now we're gonna take Randy and we brought him in. He's getting a little bit of the ignite, he's getting a little bit of, he's got the workbook, he's got all this. But it's all foundation now and it's all high level. There's nothing that's real. I'm not going to now do a one one coaching to take his business from half a million dollars a year to $5 million a year. That's a whole nother add on. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[11:09]*: Kind of just a taster. 
**Toby Potter** *[11:10]*: This is just a. What can you do for me at this level? And if you can do for me at this level then I can, you can take me to the next level. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[11:17]*: Within their first 30 or 60 days they should be adding. 
**Toby Potter** *[11:19]*: That's correct. That's correct. So and that's where you know, seeing and hearing what Alex did and I was told he has done tremendous amount in mergers and acquisitions and I had no clue of that. Has he? 
**Nick Love** *[11:42]*: Yeah, no, he owns acquisitions.com. 
**Toby Potter** *[11:45]*: But has it done anything? 
**Nick Love** *[11:47]*: Yeah, I mean he owns school, you know, I mean the school. 
**Toby Potter** *[11:50]*: Oh, school. 
**Nick Love** *[11:52]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[11:52]*: Okay. Yeah. So he has, I, I didn't realize to what degree of business he had. 
**Nick Love** *[11:58]*: It's high. 
**Toby Potter** *[11:59]*: It's high. Okay. So. And here's what we're facing. We are pigeonholed into level of expertise. Doesn't mean we can't expand upon it through our foundations and principles and all that we've done. But this is probably the biggest, negative, biggest hurdle that we have to overcome is being able to take what we've done in real estate, take what we've done against all odds and all challenges and show that as a business mindset, business foundation of ability to achieve. So that's what we have to look at when you take in Alex Hermosa and he has what, 10 million followers either. So we did it. But this deal is about packaging and being able to create value at a low cost, low entry level. So then they get the binder and then we get, they get 12 month access to our AI. 
**Toby Potter** *[13:05]*: So we would, as we've talked about. Yeah, we can, yeah. Creating a specific AI for that business. I know that one of the things that's pretty impressive with Ernesto's recursion deal, and I haven't tested it yet, but one of the things that I saw was that inside that we can create a board of directors for any and every business. And that board of directors becomes a board of directors for that challenge and task. So Randy's in as an engineer and developer for a. For pipeline companies, for plumbing pipeline companies. And he's trying to expand it. We can go in there into the recursion and say, I need. Here's the business and so you give all the data to it. And I need a board of directors of five to six board of directors. 
**Toby Potter** *[14:03]*: And it'll go back to Ben Franklin, it'll go back to Thomas Edison, it'll go back to Andrew Carney, it'll go back to wherever and find the right group of people and build that out that we can then become the voice for Randy's when he's having a meeting. So let's say every month we're part of Randy's board now. We get on, we dump all that into that recursion AI and it then gives us a model for him to implement it and to allocate. 
**Angie Potter** *[14:34]*: Is that something that needs to be an add on? 
**Nick Love** *[14:37]*: Yeah, I was about to say yeah. Because since that's almost like you can make an AI for somebody and then they maybe you continue to work on it or we have one AI that we give people access to because those are like different. Yeah. One's custom. 
**Toby Potter** *[14:53]*: Yeah. One is going to be just a voice from us as, hey, I've got an employee issue. 
**Angie Potter** *[14:59]*: I got it like a hundred thousand dollar. 
**Toby Potter** *[15:01]*: Oh, easily. Yeah. But then if Randy says, okay, I do need a board of advisors, I need a board of directors that is an add on that we can, we would establish and create. And that's where this recursion will come into play. To be able to go back to. And from what I've seen, it finds people that are experts in that industry, people who I don't even heard of, and that creates that because now we're using what they've done in the past to guide and direct on how they would do it in the future. And that's what is. And I haven't gotten it absolute. But that's what I'm seeing as the potential for the recursion program. So. And how many of us would have loved to had a board of directors? 
**Toby Potter** *[15:50]*: I know I would, you know, so many different times that, hey, you know Our industry is going this direction. What should we prevent? What should we look at? How should we guide and direct and not get stuck with COVID Not get stuck with the high interest rates. I get stuck with all these variables that are out there to help guide. And you look at the Lima ones, you look at the RCNs, you look at those guys that are doing 100, 200 million a month. They got a board of directors of extremely intelligent people. We got. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[16:23]*: Can help with. Because what worked then might not work now because now there's so much more. But I can help this check. 
**Toby Potter** *[16:31]*: But this AI is able to look forward two to three years based off of the old and what's going on. So it's pretty profound in the fact that it will help project, not predict, but project on how to get prepared for. Got you. So with that we have that ability to customize for each individual and their business and their growth. 
**Nick Love** *[16:54]*: Well, and I'd even say too, one of the great things like right now I'm recording on Fireflies. When Fireflies it's done. It goes through steps. Either way, it goes into our notion database actually now because in the Perplexity platform, I can access all the meetings. So I just mean to say that I also think that one thing that would beneficial that people would pay a lot of money for too, is instead of just access to you and a board of directors, it also can have continuous access to people's meetings. 
**Toby Potter** *[17:34]*: Absolutely. 
**Nick Love** *[17:34]*: Or tools. 
**Toby Potter** *[17:36]*: Well, this is where this roundtable has to come into play. We have to be able to become the absolute experts in what we're teaching. 
**Nick Love** *[17:45]*: Coaching. Yeah, that's. No, and I think that's what I don't see any of that with anybody's AIs. 
**Toby Potter** *[17:50]*: Okay. 
**Nick Love** *[17:50]*: From what I've seen, it's all. It's this person. It's this person's AI. 
**Toby Potter** *[17:55]*: Yeah, yeah, that's it. Robin's AI. It's the Alex Koi AI. It's. It's Andy Elliott's AI versus now we have the world's AI. 
**Nick Love** *[18:04]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[18:05]*: So this is where we have to figure out the category of one. We can't compete against Alex Hermosi. We can't compete against the Andy Elliott or the. Or the Tony Robbins. I can get on stage and compete against them. I have no fear of that. And from what we're being told, we'll blow these guys away in the next 12 to 14 months on stage. But I can't compete against them because one, they got 20 years. Head start number two. They've got millions and millions of followers ahead of us. So we're coming into the race really late. So the only way to get in front of this and to capitalize is to create a category of one at every level that we can. And so, you know, we need this right here filled with bodies. 
**Toby Potter** *[18:52]*: This, this, these 2, 4, 612 desks need to be filled full of bodies that is 100% on the phone. Balls to the wall, dealing with individuals. 
**Nick Love** *[19:04]*: Concerns, questions and answers, and getting that feedback too, right? 
**Toby Potter** *[19:10]*: While we create, develop, and implement. We've got our support staff here, and it takes up this whole room. I don't care. We take. I don't care. But this is where it changes, huh? Virtual does. Well, you still gotta have a core here that says, hey, Randy, I got a problem with Joey over here. Nick. Hey, we got it. I can't virtual. I mean, we got a virtual person right now that I've never talked to. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[19:33]*: But, you know, they could come in and be here six months, and then they go virtual and a new group comes in. 
**Toby Potter** *[19:38]*: So then you train, whatever. But, but, but what I'm always a firm believer in when we work from home. It sucked for those two, three weeks. It was terrible. And we had the ability to be on the phone with each other all we wanted. 
**Angie Potter** *[19:49]*: They might have liked it. 
**Toby Potter** *[19:50]*: They might have. 
**Angie Potter** *[19:51]*: Problem was we kept leaving going. 
**Nick Love** *[19:53]*: Look at like we, me and him were balls to the wall. 
**Toby Potter** *[19:57]*: And I don't disagree, but it was still a problem. Synergy wasn't there. The, the group growth wasn't there. You. We get to this level where I envision what I want to achieve, there's got to be a foundation of synergy here that can be then customer service out there in the virtual world. But we better have our core that says, hey, Nick, we got an AI Glitter over here. And here's what. And you can immediately jump into it. Hey, Randy, I got Joey over here that's all pissed off. All this. Rochelle, whatever. We have our immediate jump on resolution right then and there. So. But yes, creating the board of directors. I was. When were moving in, I talked to a guy out the hall. He's upstairs. And I can't remember. He was a technology guy. 
**Toby Potter** *[20:43]*: And I said, yeah, one of the amazing things is we can come in here and create your board of directors overnight. And this will help you see where you need to go, where your sales leads are. It takes all the news of today, just like all the you know, now, I don't know that it would have predicted the level of the tariffs, but I did see a case study from Ernesto where it did predict prior to the election the tariffs were. If Trump won, tariffs are gonna be a number one priority for him and revamping that. So therefore, if you're doing a lot of China, if you're doing a lot of. You need to look at alternative B. 
**Nick Love** *[21:21]*: Right. 
**Toby Potter** *[21:22]*: And see, I, I would have not known that. And I don't know how many business people would have thinking that it was gonna go to that extreme. This is where you are able to now have insight and make better decisions. This is what we're going to coach, this is what we're going to teach, this is what we're going to implement. Not that you go this way, but if this goes south, you are, you don't have to now go get your board of directors, say, what do I do next? You already have plan B in place as a fallback, just like the government does, and that they break the card during DEFCOM 2, 3. What's. If we go to 1, what happens? Well, here it already is all played out. 
**Nick Love** *[22:00]*: I was just. I feel like that is a large selling point. 
**Toby Potter** *[22:06]*: Yeah. 
**Nick Love** *[22:06]*: You're talking. Is it? I mean, even if it's something that's more quantified like we can see within a 12 month future timeline inside your specific business with all these, you know, we have it drained or whatever, I feel like that's definitely what I. 
**Angie Potter** *[22:21]*: Think is huge about why I think the price point is too low. And it may be the AI portion will pick this up. But this isn't just a one time solve. No, this is something that they can go to and reuse and reuse and it's a life. It's for life. 
**Toby Potter** *[22:48]*: Agree. 
**Nick Love** *[22:50]*: So 5000. 
**Toby Potter** *[22:52]*: They don't get any of that. 
**Angie Potter** *[22:53]*: I know, but see, but we don't. 
**Toby Potter** *[22:55]*: Have a proof of concept. So because we don't have a proof of concept, we have to get approved. We got to get the Randy's in, we got to get the shells in. 
**Angie Potter** *[23:03]*: You charge for the AI and then you charge a monthly fee to be able to continue using it so that it does encourage them to stay because once they buy this, they don't need us anymore. Well, so we need something to keep them in. 
**Toby Potter** *[23:24]*: I don't, I don't know that I agree with that as much because with everything that we've done over the last 30 years, I've had what, a dozen coaches Some good, some bad. And immediately I would know, like Christine Beckwith. I don't know if you remember her. She was terrible. 
**Angie Potter** *[23:41]*: This is beyond. 
**Toby Potter** *[23:42]*: I know, but let me. Let me finish what I'm saying. You took Grant Cardone. We brought Grant Cardone in and his program, which we never got Grant, we got all the guru, all his minions, which sucked. 
**Nick Love** *[23:53]*: I saw his coaching book too. I was gonna look through. Yeah, whatever in the pile. 
**Toby Potter** *[23:57]*: But then you take John Gigerich, you take Reuben, you take those other coaches. They always brought not enough value, but some value that I grew from. And the reason why I kept them for as long as I did because there was some gain there. And the minute that the game lost, then I quit him. So what we have to keep that in mind is are we continually bringing value to our client? No different than the Sandra and Renee versus Latate? 
**Angie Potter** *[24:30]*: And this isn't a Toby show. This is a. 
**Toby Potter** *[24:32]*: This is. Right. This cannot be a Toby show. This has to be bigger than me. 
**Angie Potter** *[24:37]*: That other people can take care of. 
**Toby Potter** *[24:39]*: That's correct. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[24:39]*: And the AI is. Is a separate bundle to this. 
**Toby Potter** *[24:43]*: There's. There's a. There's a small limitation of that. If you have small media questions about this and that, you get that level. Yeah, that's a 50 to $75,000 program, right? That's correct. But. But again, we have to give them enough now to show that the AI is a value. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[25:02]*: Yeah, that makes sense. 
**Toby Potter** *[25:04]*: You're not going to do anything unless you see value in it. And just because I tell you there's value in my weight room. 
**Nick Love** *[25:11]*: Right. 
**Toby Potter** *[25:11]*: You don't see it, you don't understand it. So why would you pay a membership? 
**Rachelle Davis** *[25:15]*: So everything about the 5000 program is a teaser. 
**Toby Potter** *[25:18]*: It's a teaser. It's an introduction. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[25:20]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[25:23]*: Teaser'S a bad word. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[25:24]*: Okay, we want you to. 
**Nick Love** *[25:28]*: Well, that's a bad word. 
**Toby Potter** *[25:31]*: You're only getting a visual of something you really want that you know, you'll never get. 
**Nick Love** *[25:35]*: That's true, but it. 
**Toby Potter** *[25:37]*: It. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[25:37]*: Yeah, it's a glimpse into your future. 
**Toby Potter** *[25:42]*: It's an introductory. 
**Nick Love** *[25:44]*: Well, the. I mean, not that we would specifically use, but if you said, you know, make. Make the high level AI and the complicated one in 24 hours, I would say that in 11 labs, like I was kind of playing yesterday, it can connect tools, and it has storage for documents and stuff. So you could easily make two separate ones with separate links or however many, I guess, supposedly. And one could connect to almost any tool that you'd wanted to do. And there might Even be potential of like, go high level is like really doubling down on AI stuff. AI agents, where we can keep it in our go high level and sell even just that AI in there to be able to do things for people too. Which is crazy, right? But we don't need to tangent. 
**Toby Potter** *[26:38]*: Yeah. And this is where we're going to have to take our own lanes and master them. I mean, Nick, there's no doubt. There's nobody here in this room that can come close to absorbing, understanding, and implementing the technology that you do. This has got to be your lane. Thousand percent. Randy. There is nobody at this table besides Angie that can deal with idiots better than you. You have this passive compassionate. I mean, kudos to you, brother, because you are a godship for me. She used to be. Yeah, she used to be good. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[27:20]*: I'm not mean to people. 
**Toby Potter** *[27:22]*: She's been worn out. I mean, screwing it only takes so much of stupidity. So you're gonna be that voice. You're gonna be that first level of, hey, let me see if I can get resolution, if I can get understanding. And then you get clarity as to what the problem is. And then you bring it back to us for us to try to figure out how do we roll to the next person differently, how do we fix this one? But then how do we make sure that the next person doesn't ever have that issue? I'm still blown away. I got an email from Sandra last night because I had told her, you go find somebody anywhere in the world that could do that's gonna give you what I've given you and I'll refund you. 
**Toby Potter** *[28:04]*: And so she came back, said, I found somebody, they're gonna buy the pop and they're gonna. I said, and I just ignored it. I know who it is, but it's still not the same. It's. They're not doing any coaching, they're not doing any of this, and that's giving you money. They're just gonna. But they're gonna buy the property, they're gonna fund it. You're gonna be boots on the ground. You're gonna do. And I think we saw, I think you presented that you ran across that the same guy. Yeah, I think it's the only person I can find in the world that does anything like. 
**Nick Love** *[28:30]*: Oh, oh, that one other guy. 
**Toby Potter** *[28:32]*: Yeah, yeah. So good run with it. But you're not getting your money back because you went 10 out of 12 weeks for the course. You're not getting your money back. I'll give you two weeks. To your money back. If that's. 
**Nick Love** *[28:41]*: And I was about to say, just on that topic of what you're saying, I think the best. The best thing too that you've alluded towards the end is the guarantee on there too. But only in the sense of like, if they did every single part of the course. They did every single. Which they didn't. Right. And the guarantee is not in like the success, but like you do everything. I mean, if they do everything, then. 
**Toby Potter** *[29:04]*: Right. 
**Nick Love** *[29:04]*: No, no, that's the thing. Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[29:05]*: It's a whole different deal. You know, they didn't want to learn, they just wanted. They just wanted money and they didn't want any. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[29:12]*: Because when Randy asked her to fill out the Excel, she's like, well, can't I just send it to you? Yeah, no, you need to learn how to know what you're doing. 
**Toby Potter** *[29:19]*: They were wanting a free ride. But then you take somebody like Tate who just. 
**Nick Love** *[29:25]*: Yeah, he'll do it. 
**Toby Potter** *[29:27]*: So. So not. We're always going to have the Sandra Renee's. I really want to have a lot more of the Tates. We're going to have the Brandon Booths. There's going to be that. You know, she asked me a while back, you know, you don't. You didn't have the talk. You had the ability and the desire and the heart to coach your loan officers, but you ran them all off, in essence. And I said, you're correct, because I'm paying them to do a job. I'm paying them to be successful and they're not willing to do what it takes to be successful. And then they want to be mad. So, yes, I had zero tolerance for that. But with the coaching, Randy's now paying me and if he didn't want to do it, I don't care. Does that make sense? It's a whole different mindset. 
**Toby Potter** *[30:15]*: If you're going to pay me 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20 grand and then not do it. 
**Nick Love** *[30:21]*: Yeah, I don't. 
**Toby Potter** *[30:22]*: There's no personal loss for me. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[30:26]*: Like it affected your company changes though. 
**Angie Potter** *[30:29]*: They on that side. But then when they bring you a property in, you're 100% in. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[30:34]*: That's the hard bit. 
**Angie Potter** *[30:35]*: And they're not. 
**Toby Potter** *[30:37]*: Well, we're not going to do that. 
**Angie Potter** *[30:39]*: That's where we're not going to do that. It gets sketchy and it gets routine. 
**Toby Potter** *[30:44]*: Yeah, but you brought up also. So to add to that, we can roll this program out. We can roll out the legacy, as in program without the partnership, but then we can choose the latex. We can choose the people say, hey, I like your property here. If you're. You know. And we'll know that's the property that. 
**Angie Potter** *[31:06]*: We want to be involved in. 
**Toby Potter** *[31:07]*: We'll help. We'll help fund this deal right now. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[31:10]*: Yeah, I think that. 
**Nick Love** *[31:11]*: Well, that's where it was in the beginning. Like, you have the option. It's not a guarantee. 
**Angie Potter** *[31:16]*: That ended up being the selling point. 
**Nick Love** *[31:18]*: Yeah. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[31:19]*: They didn't even. 
**Angie Potter** *[31:19]*: We lost. You don't have. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[31:21]*: For the appraisal. We've got a problem. 
**Angie Potter** *[31:26]*: Like, you can't. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[31:27]*: That should be the benefit in your account. You're bringing no benefit to me. 
**Toby Potter** *[31:31]*: Right, Agreed. Agreed. So we've got those. So now we're at. We're at. So we got the AI implementation. And it basically is that daily conversation kind of look at what we have right now about real estate and all that. Just more customized to everyday life. 
**Nick Love** *[31:51]*: Right. That's what's about to say. 
**Toby Potter** *[31:52]*: Yes. More of a coaching kind of like the Tony Robbins that I sent to you. Whereas. And we. And we played with it the other night. Oh, did you. 
**Nick Love** *[32:00]*: You bought it? 
**Toby Potter** *[32:01]*: No, no, yours. The one you sent to me back. Yeah. Yeah. 
**Nick Love** *[32:04]*: Oh, okay. Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[32:05]*: And I said, hey, can we just. I love it. 
**Nick Love** *[32:06]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[32:07]*: Just put it into my voice. 
**Nick Love** *[32:08]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[32:09]*: Because then if it's not my voice, then it's. It loses. 
**Nick Love** *[32:12]*: It's not you. 
**Toby Potter** *[32:12]*: Yeah, yeah. Not me coaching you to get through this. Hey, my girlfriend's cheating on me. What do I do? Dilemma. 
**Nick Love** *[32:19]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[32:20]*: So that would be the next challenge on that side of it. But then that's the level. That again. 
**Nick Love** *[32:24]*: No, no, I do have that. Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[32:27]*: Okay, perfect. And I knew you said we could, but you were looking at a different program that was a little less expensive. 
**Nick Love** *[32:32]*: Well, that. That's the thing is, like, there's. 
**Toby Potter** *[32:35]*: Because 11 labs is going to get expensive doing it, wasn't it? 
**Nick Love** *[32:37]*: Well, that's where it's. I should probably, like, calculate, maybe just like, give a range. But it would. 11 labs will like, charge you to use the voice, and then you'll get charged to, like, use the. The AI and that'll be integration. Anybody using it. But. 
**Toby Potter** *[32:55]*: So every time we handed it out, we got a fee on it. 
**Nick Love** *[32:59]*: Or they. Every time they use it. 
**Toby Potter** *[33:00]*: Oh, every time. So I give it to Randy now. Every time he. 
**Nick Love** *[33:03]*: It's low. Right. 
**Toby Potter** *[33:04]*: But, but, but you get 100, 240. It's going to add up fast. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[33:10]*: Found Gro AI and he has acted 50 million things the last two days just because it's. He's so interested in seeing what all it'll do. 
**Nick Love** *[33:17]*: That's why they have like all these large, you know, data centers and problems and stuff. But where I was going to like go around is that there's, you know, in the tech world they have like what they call the closed. Closed source, which is Chad GPT. Right. It's closed, it's not free. You have to pay for it. You use their infrastructure, everything. And then they have what they call open source which is like, hey, this is this code or this thing on the Internet. You can download it and practically own it for yourself and keep it. And so there are like open source, like voice programs that say so we can like clone your voice. It may not be as good, but technology gets better, right? Incrementally. 
**Nick Love** *[33:54]*: And so there might be like a way that we get that for free, but then it's, you know, then if we have our own AI, well then now we got, you know, both hands. 
**Toby Potter** *[34:02]*: So that, and this is where I, I believe where we need to get and build a server so that we house it, we control it and we have it all under our domain. Agree. Okay. So we'd have. So we have those, that level and then it goes from there to the next level of implementation for AI, whether we do the board of directors. So we will need to. I'll need to dig a little more into it because we need multiple levels of that. Randy may not need a board of directors, but he does need specific guidance and direction on projections for his business. Sales guys, you know Kyle and is Kyle come. Kyle's not coming to the wedding, is he? No, because I know but he hit. 
**Speaker 5** *[34:50]*: On Amber in front of comments. 
**Angie Potter** *[34:51]*: Oh yeah, that's right. 
**Nick Love** *[34:52]*: Oh geez. 
**Toby Potter** *[34:52]*: So cool. I like that guy. 
**Angie Potter** *[34:54]*: So he's also the one that made Dustin so happy. 
**Toby Potter** *[34:58]*: Yeah, I like that guy. But anyway, he's a perfect example of somebody who was a, a coach teacher forever. Could never state keep a job there. Went into sales and he's learning. He's got great personality, he's got great confidence. But see he's somebody that we can create a sales AI for overcoming objections. And the simple thing was he called, he said, hey, I'm doing peos and I've got this company and there's the owner and then there's the right hand guy. And the right hand guy's in. He says he's willing to implement but he can't ever get in front of the owner to get him to set a time and date for me to come present to them both. And he goes but now I've got this guy loaded. What would you do? 
**Toby Potter** *[35:44]*: And I said well the first thing I would do would I would send the guy a thank you card with a small gift saying thank you so much for considering even though you've never met the guy but say thank you for considering me and it's an honor, it's a privilege. And and because of this and build up his company what he's done and built on it and just send that to him. And I look forward to the opportunity to sit down and meet with you because we don't know if the right hand guy has ever even presented it to you. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[36:09]*: It might be a. I really like you right. 
**Toby Potter** *[36:11]*: But I can use this as right. But then now you now put the owner on pedestal. Hey who the hell is this guy? I don't know anything about this. And get you in. And then number two now you've got that you know you've already set him on a pedestal. You've already created this. And so went through it and he said dude that is the smartest. 
**Nick Love** *[36:31]*: Thing I've ever heard. 
**Toby Potter** *[36:31]*: I said that's why they pay me the big bucks. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[36:34]*: Yeah. I feel like the sales AI where they're getting for my know how do I make them feel better? That's going to be. I think that's your strongest point is the sales have real estate sales. 
**Toby Potter** *[36:47]*: No it's I can outsell anybody. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[36:50]*: I need a parker in done abroad of sales already so you're not so. 
**Toby Potter** *[36:53]*: Pigeonholed into real estate so that so when we talk about the different AI levels we have this kind of personal coaching ignite AI that they get part of this bundle but then we go to the next levels. He needs mid level management. How do I manage my employees better? I'll CEO. How do I I'm a sales guy. How do I so we can have these different levels of AI that you can upgrade to based upon and each level is a higher price point. If I'm just a sales guy, maybe that's just a. A $10,000 AI. If I'm a mid level manager maybe that's a $19,000. If I'm a CEO that's a $25,000. So that because of what we have to orchestrate in development create that's going to be that level and the valuation. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[37:41]*: Comes back for a sales team like someone wants oh that would be a mid level manager. 
**Toby Potter** *[37:47]*: Yeah. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[37:47]*: Well everybody on the team so then they have 20 seats and that's it. That can log into it and then you can customize that price tag for that so they don't have to each have their own. 
**Toby Potter** *[37:57]*: So yes. Okay. Okay. And yeah, so yeah, absolutely. Because his personality is different than his yours. How you present, how he presents. So you're going to have to. Your issues are going to be different. You know, you're going to be able to understand. How to communicate but yet you're a female. And so you've got to compete with the. The type a male clients. He's not gonna have that problem. So you can say okay, so I got Jackass Toby Potter getting ready to talk to. He's this and this. How do I appeal to that personality? And the AI gives you some scripts and some understandings so that you as a female can talk to a jerk. 
**Angie Potter** *[38:44]*: Right. 
**Toby Potter** *[38:44]*: Does that make sense? Yeah. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[38:45]*: Chauvinistic. 
**Toby Potter** *[38:46]*: Yeah, that was the word I was looking for. I just couldn't come up with it right now. 
**Angie Potter** *[38:49]*: Narcissistic. 
**Toby Potter** *[38:50]*: Narcissistic. John A. John Hornick. Yeah. So how. You know, I got. I've got a dilemma. How do I deal with it? John Beach. So this gives you that confidence and strategy and structure on how to now present your plan. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[39:05]*: Right. 
**Toby Potter** *[39:05]*: That's the AI that changes the world. 
**Angie Potter** *[39:09]*: Present to that kind of mentality. Because if John Beecham, the person you can't talk to and no. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[39:19]*: Flatter him, he'll listen all day to you. He just wants to talk about it. Beachum's total different. He just wants to make you feel small. 
**Angie Potter** *[39:26]*: Beachum's to the point and be safe all. 
**Toby Potter** *[39:30]*: So we have, so we have. And this is what Nick and I will go through. But we have multiple levels of this to evolve. 
**Nick Love** *[39:37]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[39:39]*: But yeah, this is the Category 1 caveat that helps us really move faster throughout live implementation. So within that potentially have a couple of half day group trainings for those individuals for each sponsor. Yeah. 
**Nick Love** *[40:03]*: But. 
**Toby Potter** *[40:04]*: But as a community. So like a webinar, right? Yeah, yeah. So for just all the sponsors at one time specific, right? Yeah. Not one. I gotta get food because that's kicking me in. Food. Yeah. Some of that help. 
**Speaker 5** *[40:22]*: Discipline baby. You gotta get some. 
**Nick Love** *[40:27]*: So when is Amber's wedding? 
**Angie Potter** *[40:28]*: Sunday. 
**Nick Love** *[40:29]*: Sunday? Oh, it's on Sunday. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[40:30]*: What time is it at again? 
**Toby Potter** *[40:32]*: 5. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[40:32]*: That's what I thought, but I couldn't remember. 
**Speaker 5** *[40:34]*: Hash browns. You need some coaching? 
**Toby Potter** *[40:37]*: Something? I didn't get a milkshake this morning. Sorry. 
**Nick Love** *[40:40]*: You need some coaching? 
**Toby Potter** *[40:41]*: Yeah, I didn't get a milk this morning, so. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[40:44]*: Hey, you can have chicken from my house. That's all we seem to eat. 
**Toby Potter** *[40:46]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 5** *[40:47]*: So essentially, this is 500 a person, and you get access for a year. Breaking it down, it's 5,000 total. 
**Toby Potter** *[40:56]*: But. But the other. No, no. The other 10 don't get this. It comes in later. 
**Speaker 5** *[41:00]*: Comes in later. 
**Toby Potter** *[41:01]*: Yeah. The other 10 don't get the. This is for the one guy that gets the Tim. Tickets only. 
**Nick Love** *[41:06]*: Yes. 
**Speaker 5** *[41:06]*: I didn't. 
**Toby Potter** *[41:07]*: Yeah. Yes. Okay. So part of. So you pay $5,000. Example. You get all this, plus 10 tickets to give away to come to the event. 
**Speaker 5** *[41:17]*: Just event tickets. 
**Toby Potter** *[41:18]*: Yes. 
**Speaker 5** *[41:19]*: Okay. 
**Toby Potter** *[41:20]*: Yes. 
**Speaker 5** *[41:20]*: That makes more sense because I'm like, each. Well, I thought I said each person. 
**Angie Potter** *[41:24]*: Gets a book, each person gets an event ticket. 
**Speaker 5** *[41:29]*: Where did I read that? 
**Toby Potter** *[41:30]*: So right here, number six, sponsor 10 unshakable seats. 
**Nick Love** *[41:37]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[41:38]*: Every bundle purchase one full access seat for the buyer, plus 10 excess seats to veterans. 
**Speaker 5** *[41:46]*: Each sponsored seat gets 12 months of the program, a digital version of the playbook and access community court costs. 
**Toby Potter** *[41:52]*: Digital version. That's correct. 
**Speaker 5** *[41:54]*: Got it. 12 months of the digital program. Okay, so they'll just get a. 
**Toby Potter** *[41:58]*: They just get a small version of everything. And it's kind of a condition. 
**Speaker 5** *[42:01]*: That's it. They get those three things. 
**Toby Potter** *[42:03]*: They get the event, and they get 12 months of the digital program and. 
**Speaker 5** *[42:08]*: Access to be on all the calls. 
**Toby Potter** *[42:09]*: That gives you numbers. That's right. That's right. 
**Nick Love** *[42:12]*: Okay. 
**Toby Potter** *[42:15]*: So you get this whole package, but now you're employed. 
**Speaker 5** *[42:18]*: These people with you for the. 
**Toby Potter** *[42:20]*: Get the small. Yes. 
**Nick Love** *[42:21]*: Okay. 
**Toby Potter** *[42:21]*: Gets us our group. And then this helps us. Because it may not be your employees. Like I said, it may be your buddies. It could be. It could be your buddies, whoever. And they need one. 
**Nick Love** *[42:32]*: We doing. 
**Toby Potter** *[42:32]*: Sure. Okay. All right. So got the two, six. Two live events, then you got the community, you got the seats. And then you have some bonus stacking on that. 
**Angie Potter** *[42:49]*: I see that you are. You're telling them basically who they can give the. 
**Toby Potter** *[42:56]*: No, just give them up. Just. Just give them things to think about. 
**Angie Potter** *[42:59]*: Okay. Because it can be anybody business. 
**Toby Potter** *[43:02]*: Right, right, right. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[43:03]*: Well, and if they can get any of their 10 to sign up, would you give them like a hundred dollars person they sign up, that's a thousand dollars off their price tag. And they brought 10 new people in. Do you see what I'm saying? 
**Speaker 5** *[43:18]*: They'd be buying something different. 
**Toby Potter** *[43:20]*: Who you talking about? 
**Rachelle Davis** *[43:21]*: I'm saying it's buying it. If the sponsor gets their 10 people to then buy a package, do you have any incentive for them to get the 10 people to keep up with the 10 people to get them to buy it is my question. 
**Toby Potter** *[43:36]*: So might be a headache. You were a sponsor, you brought in 10 of your friends, business workers and they decided to upgrade to this. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[43:45]*: Right. 
**Toby Potter** *[43:46]*: Giving you credit for that. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[43:48]*: Given some sort of incentive to get them to like, you know how we used to do referral, like if you get someone multi level market. Yeah. So then they benefit from it a little bit. But you've got 10 new people that signed up that wouldn't ever have necessarily known about the program. I mean people tend to care if there's incentive for them. 
**Toby Potter** *[44:10]*: Oh, that's all I care about. Yeah. There has to be value. The raspberry value. Who did he take a call? 
**Nick Love** *[44:23]*: I think one. 
**Angie Potter** *[44:26]*: I know his phone was blowing up. 
**Toby Potter** *[44:28]*: Yeah. So. And this is what Alex Hermosi did. And I don't. I'm trying to. I'm trying to find it, see if it's published then event. So I can kind of go through it. 
**Nick Love** *[44:42]*: The seven hour event. 
**Toby Potter** *[44:43]*: Yeah, yeah, it is. Where it pro. 
**Nick Love** *[44:46]*: It's on his YouTube, I think. 
**Toby Potter** *[44:49]*: I went through it and I couldn't find it. It's August 16th. I have the date that it happened, but I couldn't find. 
**Nick Love** *[44:55]*: Is it that long ago? 
**Toby Potter** *[44:56]*: Yeah, seemed like it was two weeks ago from whatever talking. 
**Nick Love** *[44:59]*: It feels like it. Yeah. No, I didn't know it's that long ago. 
**Toby Potter** *[45:02]*: He. 
**Nick Love** *[45:03]*: I remember. See, I know it was seven or eight hours. 
**Toby Potter** *[45:05]*: You. Yeah, seven and a half hours. Yeah. It was like five hours just talking. And then he. Then he brings out the. The package and when he talks he has testimonials. He has people get on there. They just talk about all that he's done and never even talks about the package until the last hour and a half. And then it was gangbusters. Yeah. 
**Nick Love** *[45:25]*: He made a hundred million. 
**Toby Potter** *[45:27]*: Yeah, 100 million in seven hours. He brought. Bro. 
**Nick Love** *[45:31]*: He had literally Guinness World Record people there because he knew he was gonna break world records. 
**Toby Potter** *[45:37]*: It was unbelievable. So what he did. Yeah. Was a 200 book giveaway. That was the whole platform was. 
**Nick Love** *[45:43]*: Yeah, you're gonna buy one book and. 
**Toby Potter** *[45:45]*: You'Re gonna give away 199 of them. And this book was about business and finances and philosophies and all that because. But then there was of course several upsells within that. But this is that same concept. So we want to do two things in this format. One is to enroll people into our program now the $5,000 deal. But more importantly, we want to sell the 10 seats to our live event. Mainly because proof of concept is limited right now. Now you. We have five people that were. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[46:25]*: Three. 
**Toby Potter** *[46:26]*: Three. 
**Nick Love** *[46:27]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[46:27]*: Plus Tate. Plus Sullivan. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[46:31]*: Yeah, I haven't talked to Sullivan. 
**Toby Potter** *[46:33]*: Okay, so for testimonials, for video testimonials. 
**Nick Love** *[46:44]*: But they're connected. The program and the event. You know, you kind of made it because you buy. By buying the program, you buy the event. 
**Toby Potter** *[46:54]*: That's correct. Yeah, that's correct. And the reason why I want to. This is good. To bring us good cash flow, but more importantly to fill the seats at the event so that we can just knock the ball. Yeah, we can knock the ball out of the park. Okay. And so that's what I'm trying to. That's why this is so cheap here for butts and seats mindset. 
**Angie Potter** *[47:21]*: So yeah, my concern is. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[47:26]*: It'S. 
**Angie Potter** *[47:27]*: A year long program and the venue, the food, that all that's all going to cost money and what, so two different things? No, but you're selling it for 5,000 for 10 people or 11, however the. 
**Speaker 5** *[47:45]*: Stuff that they are getting. 
**Angie Potter** *[47:46]*: Giving them 10 tickets to the event. 
**Toby Potter** *[47:49]*: Okay, okay, okay. 
**Angie Potter** *[47:51]*: That is 11 people. 
**Toby Potter** *[47:52]*: Uhhuh. 
**Angie Potter** *[47:53]*: And you got $5,000. But you got a venue you got to pay for. You got food you got to pay for. 
**Toby Potter** *[48:00]*: Speakers are. Pay for all that. Okay. Speakers are paying for all that. Okay. So we should be out zero money on the cost of the event. 
**Angie Potter** *[48:09]*: That 5, $6,000 has to go to this, Right? 
**Toby Potter** *[48:13]*: Right, that's correct. 
**Angie Potter** *[48:14]*: And when it's going all to an event, then we've got nothing to carry us forward for a year. 
**Toby Potter** *[48:21]*: Other than. No, you're not wrong. Other than we get 5, 600 people at the event and we sell another 100 programs. 
**Angie Potter** *[48:32]*: Possibly, but you can't count that. You can only count what you got at the time the event is done. And then the other is upsells. 
**Toby Potter** *[48:43]*: I know my name is Toby Potter when I see it. So just. I know we just met. We can go out to drinks afterwards, lady. And I'll tell you how great I am. 
**Speaker 5** *[49:03]*: So plus aside from the event, because that's where the money goes. This stuff that you're giving away is already made, meaning it doesn't cost us any extra money. You make it once and you distribute. The only thing is just the time. 
**Toby Potter** *[49:18]*: The time on the calls. 
**Speaker 5** *[49:20]*: But we're doing that anyways, right? 
**Angie Potter** *[49:22]*: I mean your winner. Yeah. Whatever you're working on, you're still cost me here and the spot costs. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[49:31]*: Me and you know. 
**Toby Potter** *[49:32]*: Wow. She's never said that before. Randy. 
**Angie Potter** *[49:35]*: I've got to make sure. I've got to make sure that. Agree that monthly is still coming in that it's not a one time hit and then we're done. 
**Toby Potter** *[49:46]*: Right. Like we just did a year. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[49:48]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[49:48]*: Yes. We just. We just launched the Ascend in Legacy. Did $40,000. No, we didn't want that. 
**Nick Love** *[49:56]*: So yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[49:58]*: Let's just say we did $60,000 and 70% that went right back to the people. So. But, but I love knowing now. We learned a lot. We learned a lot. Yeah. The education I got from it and it was. I mean I'm with you. The program is phenomenal. But I think in talking to outsiders, it's too good to be true. And nobody wants to believe it to be real. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[50:30]*: They want to see somebody else do it before they spend the money on it. Everybody wants to see somebody else win before they spend the money. 
**Nick Love** *[50:39]*: So we. So then that. What I hear from that is that we need to take more. Show more risk away. We didn't really talk about any of the guarantee as much I don't think as we probably could have. If it's really true we have to take more risk away from people then if that's the problem. Perceived risk. Not literally. 
**Toby Potter** *[51:00]*: What do you mean by that? 
**Nick Love** *[51:03]*: So you know, like I was saying, if we. Because, Because I do believe if somebody like latate. You do analyze deals every day like what you talk about certain amount of deals, you send in a certain amount offers. You're using the tools you take the courses, you're talking with you going through deals. You're gonna get a fucking deal. Let's get to work. I mean it's almost a fact. 
**Toby Potter** *[51:24]*: How many deals has he got that are viable? 
**Nick Love** *[51:27]*: So many? He has the best one. 
**Toby Potter** *[51:29]*: Yeah. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[51:29]*: As far as Afghanistan, some good ones. But like he's had some that came out green from the start versus they're yellow red. Because he's gonna lowball the out of them. But he seems to. You can see the transition from when the deals first started to what he's looking at now. 
**Toby Potter** *[51:48]*: He's. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[51:49]*: You can see the growth. You know what I mean? Like, versus at the beginning if he. It was on there for him to look at. He was throwing it into the thing he didn't miss. 
**Angie Potter** *[51:58]*: Yeah. What kind of. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[52:00]*: I mean I'm gonna offer you 150 less for your home. Even though you could sell. People can move into it today and you're. No one's gonna take that. I mean like right now he's not doing. But you don't know, but he's not doing that anymore. He's rising up because it's a waste of his time. 
**Toby Potter** *[52:14]*: Yeah. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[52:15]*: So you can see the program working. 
**Toby Potter** *[52:20]*: All the way through and that's. 
**Nick Love** *[52:21]*: What I mean, it's like we, so we, since we have that confidence in that, for example, giving somebody a guarantee that you will give them their money back, you try everything and it doesn't work. It can't be somebody who joins in. They don't do crap and they don't get a result. And so. But we take risk away from somebody like latate who didn't join yet being like, hey, like, look, you go, you, we have this full program. We have it all laid out. And I'm telling you right now, you do all that doesn't work, we'll give your money back. That like just takes all the risk away. And we already know that it's going to work if they do what they, what we tell them to do. That's the whole point. 
**Toby Potter** *[52:58]*: And it's no different. Police academy college professors gave us curriculum, said, if you study this, you'll learn this. 
**Nick Love** *[53:10]*: Yeah. It's so simple, black and white. 
**Toby Potter** *[53:13]*: Yeah. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[53:14]*: But when we become adults, all of. 
**Angie Potter** *[53:15]*: A sudden it doesn't. Well, I don't want to do that. 
**Toby Potter** *[53:17]*: I just want the success. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[53:19]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[53:19]*: You take, you take somebody like Brandon Booth who was on fire, then wasn't, and now is distraught it because it didn't work out quick enough. But then you go back and say, well, buddy, in the first week you submitted 14 deals. In the next 90 days you submitted six. Two more. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[53:36]*: Yeah, I got one from him and. 
**Angie Potter** *[53:40]*: That expected to already make money within 60 days. He didn't. 
**Toby Potter** *[53:44]*: Right. It wasn't realistic, but. And all I ever said was if you do what I tell you to do, you'll have a property under a contract within 30 to 45 days. And everybody that did it did. 
**Nick Love** *[53:57]*: He never used the new tools. 
**Toby Potter** *[53:58]*: Never used. Never used. So I think the program will work 100%. Ascend Legacy. And I want to remove this in and just have just the leg aside from the partnering. But we will help you get funds and fund the deal. 
**Nick Love** *[54:14]*: And I, and I do think you should. 
**Toby Potter** *[54:15]*: Yeah. 
**Nick Love** *[54:16]*: Yeah. Guarantee it like that. 
**Toby Potter** *[54:19]*: So that's fine. So. But, but we what we in. In. 
**Angie Potter** *[54:25]*: I think we need to sell more as we have the ability to assist. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[54:28]*: In funding we have, we can help underwrite, analyze your deal so there's no surprises. 
**Angie Potter** *[54:34]*: Deal is different through your transition too. And then we're not selling as every single deal that comes through the door. We're investing in it. 
**Toby Potter** *[54:44]*: Agree, agree. But we also need to make sure that we broaden our leadership outside of real estate. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[54:53]*: Oh, 100%. Coaching up teams is such a stronger, broader way to go than real estate. 
**Toby Potter** *[55:06]*: Agreed. So now we're at 6 on the sponsorship. That's what that. That provides to it. And then we have some bonus tax on here. You know, bringing in partners. 
**Nick Love** *[55:18]*: Yeah, that's us. The. The event you should like, you can get singles or partner tickets. 
**Toby Potter** *[55:25]*: And then you're right. We talk about the risk reversal scarcity of, you know, giving them the ability to get a refund under certain criteria. 
**Nick Love** *[55:39]*: Yeah, yeah. That's also what Alex Hormozi did really well was his scarcity. 
**Toby Potter** *[55:47]*: Yeah, Scarcity, from what being told, was pretty profound. 
**Nick Love** *[55:53]*: Well, he was even like, we have. I'm pretty sure he said, we have 1.2 million people on this session right now. We only have 200,000 books. That's what he said. That's not true. Right. Or who knows? But so he. Yeah, so he sold all of them. 
**Toby Potter** *[56:12]*: And from what I've learned, I'll guarantee he didn't have any of the. We might have had like 20 of them in print to show. Yeah, the rest of them are all being printed after Bob. 
**Nick Love** *[56:21]*: And more than that. Yeah, yeah. But that was very literal. 
**Toby Potter** *[56:28]*: All right, any questions? 
**Nick Love** *[56:32]*: Well, I mean, it sounds like the main thing is to work on getting people to the event, not necessarily building the product to sell it right now. 
**Toby Potter** *[56:42]*: So Jason Wong, Joe's team. 
**Nick Love** *[56:44]*: Oh, yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[56:45]*: Creating the webinar stuff for us to do a webinar every week, Live webinars for at least the first four months. 
**Nick Love** *[56:54]*: So what do they. That entail them like their turnkey. 
**Toby Potter** *[56:58]*: They're creating the. Really the funnels. They're creating messaging. 
**Nick Love** *[57:03]*: They're creating the exact content and what's. 
**Toby Potter** *[57:07]*: It and all that. We spent probably two hours. Jason Wojo, W O J O. He is the guy that does all this for Alex Hermosi. That's how I've heard about this. 
**Nick Love** *[57:21]*: Yeah. I was like, yeah, his name sounds. 
**Toby Potter** *[57:23]*: He does it for Tony Robbins. He's. He's right there, side of him. And Russell Brunson. Not Russell Brunson. That's. What. 
**Nick Love** *[57:32]*: What? No, Russell Brunson's quick. 
**Toby Potter** *[57:33]*: Is it Bronson? Okay, okay. I think Charles Brunson. Okay, cool. Yeah. 
**Nick Love** *[57:37]*: And there's Russell Branson, who did Virgin. 
**Toby Potter** *[57:39]*: Okay, so Russell Branson, Charles Brunson, Russell Brunson. So those two got together and had a kid, but Russell Brunson. So him and Russell Brunson are. They came up together and then split off. Russell went to clickfunnels. Jason went to webinars. Jason, from everything that I can find, unless you guys can correct me, is the guru for webinars. So he is going to do this. So it's a turnkey package, content, click funnels, leads, all that stuff. 
**Nick Love** *[58:22]*: So if they're gonna set up, I mean, that'll be different from our go high level stuff. 
**Toby Potter** *[58:26]*: They want go high level. 
**Nick Love** *[58:28]*: Okay. So, yeah, because they're gonna. Clickfunnels have its own. 
**Toby Potter** *[58:31]*: They'll do it in our. Okay, no, clickfunnels is not okay. So they're split out. So, yeah, they do it in our go high level platform. 
**Nick Love** *[58:38]*: Good. 
**Toby Potter** *[58:39]*: I sent them everything that we've done. I've sent them everything that we've got. Our booktubbypotter.com site. You've got to work on that. So we have two things moving right now. We have the webinar that they're working on building out and creating, establishing so that we do a webinar every week that is to push and promote this. So we had to build a package of content to do and then push and promote to the live event. And then we have the meeting were on yesterday for a firm. Their sole job is to book me on stages. Big, medium, large, doesn't matter. I have to be on stages. I've screamed and hollered to the top of the mountains that if I'm not on three to five stages a month, I'm going to start firing some people. So they're now bringing that into play. 
**Toby Potter** *[59:40]*: So number one, we have to fix the book. Toby Potter.com so that you. There's just a links throughout the whole deal. Book, book, book. Okay, number two, we have to fix all our LinkedIn sites. Okay. 
**Nick Love** *[59:54]*: Oh, I was like, okay, I see. 
**Toby Potter** *[59:57]*: We have to fix our personal LinkedIn sites so that if at any point in time they need to talk to Nick, talk to Rochelle and talk to Randy when they go to look at you. So somebody who's booking me to get on stage and they look at my kids team, they need to know what the team is, who they are and what they stand for. And if there's nothing, if there's anything on there that doesn't tie to me as a speaker, we lose credibility. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[01:00:19]*: Oh, I would need help with mine. 10 years. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:00:22]*: He's the same. 
**Nick Love** *[01:00:24]*: 10 years. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[01:00:25]*: And yeah, I mean, I haven't used it. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:00:29]*: All it is we just have to change the titles. The. 
**Nick Love** *[01:00:36]*: I was gonna make a. I can make a Unshakable Investor LinkedIn page so that you can have it all. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:00:40]*: We need that. Yeah, because right now I need to remove. 
**Nick Love** *[01:00:42]*: And post to it. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:00:43]*: I need to remove that. I'm the president CEO because right now I'm the president CEO of Global Integrity Finance. Oh, yeah, that's got to go away. The unshakeable investor has to go in and so that when they click on it goes to that page. 
**Nick Love** *[01:00:56]*: Yeah, that's. Yeah, that's pretty easy. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:00:59]*: So I'm going to start working on that. So we have the. 
**Nick Love** *[01:01:02]*: I can do that. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:01:03]*: That's right. I'm talking about changing my personal updated. So we have these two platforms running. We have Jason Lojo doing the webinars, the real webinars, not this BBV crap that we fell flat on our face with. And then we have Synergy. Yeah, Synergy who's booking me on stages. Okay, no, synergists. Synergists. Synergists. I know Synergist who's. Whose exclusive job is to book me on stages. So. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:01:41]*: And when will they start? Are they starting? 
**Toby Potter** *[01:01:43]*: So they're starting to prep their call center now with all the data we provided to them. But we probably won't be making calls till December. December 3rd. Gotta get past the wedding. We've got to update our sides, huh? 
**Nick Love** *[01:01:57]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:01:58]*: Thanksgiving. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:01:58]*: Thanksgiving, yeah. So we got some things coming up these next two weeks, but then December 3rd, they're gonna be dialing for dollars, etc. But what we don't want is for somebody to call Nick. And Nick said, well, let me go see who this guy is. Well, this guy's a lender. He's a hard money lender. He's a real estate. I don't need him. I'm in technology or I'm in sales, cars, whatever. Right. We need that. So we have to create that perception. We have three people right now. So also what I'm going to work on is guest speakers for the Monday morning calls. So probably once or twice a month having a guest speaker, somebody else that's always pushing us. Okay. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:02:38]*: Their job is to be on our call, be motivational, but always to talk about why you need a coach, how good a coach is, what the values of coaching and all that and creating, building that. And then those now are being chopped up and sent out into social media as we load those through. Okay. The ignite. 
**Nick Love** *[01:03:01]*: I Do think on that. I think we could. Might be able to get you a better camera in your. Like a cheap camera, obviously, but a webcam that might look less h. I. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:03:14]*: Think I want to do everything in there. I think I. Oh, yeah. Forgot about that. 
**Nick Love** *[01:03:18]*: Yeah, I did. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:03:19]*: So once we get that. Never mind. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:03:22]*: You spent all day in there. 
**Nick Love** *[01:03:24]*: I know, I know. It's so true. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:03:27]*: That's his new. 
**Nick Love** *[01:03:28]*: It's so much harder than it looks, by the way. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:03:31]*: But yeah, no, I want everything set. Do that in there. 
**Nick Love** *[01:03:33]*: Okay. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:03:34]*: So we do have the right light, right atmosphere. Everything pronounces the same every time I'm on a call. Okay. 
**Nick Love** *[01:03:42]*: And then I was also thinking about you webinars. You're ideally trying to sell the tickets or do things for that too or have some type of giveaway or lead magnets or something that we can do. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:03:56]*: Because that'll be the vision that I have is that we do three to five satellite events. So like the February 12th is what I call a satellite event. And when I say satellite, it's probably not the right word. 
**Nick Love** *[01:04:12]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:04:12]*: But it's a. It's a. It's a mini event. 100, 200, 300 people. Okay. Small little events. I want to do three to five of those throughout the nation. So Kansas, Bloomdale or Virginia. So we have about five locations that we can go to that we have networks within through the BTBY group. That is a Toby Potter event. The unshakable event to rally up for annual awards banquet event. A two, three day event, mega event. So all these little half day, one day deals are all. And then all the other stages that I'm on are all pushing towards get your tickets now for this. And if you're part of this program, you'll be getting awards at the end of the year. 
**Nick Love** *[01:05:08]*: That's what I was about to say. We should add that inside the Also saw. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:05:13]*: And I know that they have presented like going to a large Airbnb. Same Florida. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:05:21]*: Yeah. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:05:21]*: Where the rooms have their own bathrooms so that you have like you take 10 people, 10 grand at least each. And you can have a. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:05:33]*: A fishing trip, like an excursion or. 
**Nick Love** *[01:05:38]*: Maybe the best people from that. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:05:39]*: Yeah, yeah. So you get an excursion, you get a. 
**Nick Love** *[01:05:42]*: So cool. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:05:44]*: Just a personal event. 
**Nick Love** *[01:05:45]*: Right, right. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:05:46]*: Workshop. 
**Nick Love** *[01:05:47]*: Yeah, that's. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:05:48]*: I was president's club. Yeah, President's club. Workshop. You get it. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:05:52]*: But they have to pay to go to it. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:05:53]*: They qualify. 
**Nick Love** *[01:05:54]*: Yeah, yeah, of course. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:05:55]*: Qualify and pay. That's correct. Yeah. So yeah. So that's kind of what we're evolving all this into. 
**Nick Love** *[01:06:02]*: But you're probably going to want to have those, like, some of the physical products with you at your first speaking event. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:06:08]*: Yes. 
**Nick Love** *[01:06:09]*: To be able to. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:06:09]*: Yes, yes, absolutely. 
**Nick Love** *[01:06:11]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:06:13]*: We're just scratching the surface on the platform. We now need to start finalizing it, putting it into stone, and then running. 
**Nick Love** *[01:06:24]*: With it also as like an immediate income maker, potentially. All these guys, Tony Robbins andy Elliott and I'm sure others are directly running ads for their AIs. So if that was one of the more priorities, either low level, mid or high level, that could probably. Probably be something that could be up and running and making earning sell on its own. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:06:53]*: It could sell and not even have to have the coaching. It can sell by itself. It can sell by itself and then just have. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:07:02]*: So I'm gonna. I'm gonna go play three levels of AI. We'll start with three levels of AI. 
**Nick Love** *[01:07:12]*: Because what. Not a lot of data I have is on, like. I mean, I do have, I guess, a lot of personal growth stuff, but if you want to include, like, family and relationships, we. I like, would need more data from you. Yeah, from places, which is interesting. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:07:28]*: You're gonna get a lot of that Sunday at the father of the bride. 
**Nick Love** *[01:07:33]*: I didn't get invited yet. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:07:34]*: Oh, you know what? 
**Nick Love** *[01:07:35]*: No, I'm not going. And I'm. I'm okay with it. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[01:07:40]*: I didn't know. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:07:41]*: I think it's Amber. 
**Nick Love** *[01:07:43]*: Yeah, we. I don't know. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:07:44]*: I don't know her. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[01:07:45]*: I am sorry. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:07:46]*: I don't know who got invited. Did you get invited? Yes, I got. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:07:49]*: Okay. 
**Nick Love** *[01:07:50]*: I'm fine with. 
**Rachelle Davis** *[01:07:51]*: I've known her since she was. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:07:52]*: My wife is at the bachelorette party. 
**Nick Love** *[01:07:53]*: She ain't even in the wedding. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:07:57]*: I didn't know that. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:07:58]*: They're supplying the Lamborghini. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:08:00]*: Yeah, we gotta pick that up someday. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:08:02]*: Michaela's gonna bring it to you. 
**Nick Love** *[01:08:03]*: She's riding a Lamborghini. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:08:04]*: Well, it's a little cold. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:08:05]*: Camden is coming down. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:08:09]*: Show Nick the video. You'll love this. 
**Nick Love** *[01:08:11]*: Okay. Oh, going down the aisle. Oh, my gosh. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:08:17]*: Did you just crash it? 
**Toby Potter** *[01:08:17]*: Just come. No, you are invited. You're more than invited, buddy. 
**Nick Love** *[01:08:23]*: I'm not crashing. I'm not gonna. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:08:24]*: We have plenty of empty seats. We're paying for more that's showing up. 
**Nick Love** *[01:08:28]*: No, it's okay. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:08:29]*: Is Brenda coming? 
**Toby Potter** *[01:08:31]*: They're coming in today. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:08:33]*: Anybody else from her, like, is. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:08:35]*: Reuben and Clyde were invited, but Reuben's traveling. He's got some. Oh, yeah. 
**Nick Love** *[01:08:39]*: How is he doing? How. That's. How does that. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:08:42]*: Is he Going to be a guest speaker one of your calls. Is he willing to do that? 
**Nick Love** *[01:08:44]*: That would be cool. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:08:45]*: He's the one told me to do it. 
**Nick Love** *[01:08:47]*: Oh, my gosh. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:08:48]*: He's the one that told me that's how he's gonna come down the aisle. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:08:54]*: Oh, my God. 
**Nick Love** *[01:08:55]*: That's so. I can't believe they can actually drive that. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:08:57]*: No, that's me. 
**Nick Love** *[01:08:59]*: Oh, I was like, what? That's me. He just doesn't say, oh, my gosh, that's so cool. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:09:08]*: So. 
**Nick Love** *[01:09:11]*: So yeah, with the. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:09:13]*: Now you do have. They do have chapters one through six. Talks about. In the book that I wrote that I never have completed, that I dumped to you. 
**Nick Love** *[01:09:24]*: There's like. I mean, there's more than six chapters, but. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:09:26]*: But I think one through six was all childhood. But what you're. 
**Nick Love** *[01:09:30]*: Oh, one through four. Yeah, yeah, I do have that. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:09:33]*: Okay. 
**Nick Love** *[01:09:35]*: And I probably don't necessarily. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:09:38]*: And you know, let's stick with. 
**Nick Love** *[01:09:41]*: You've been recording all your speeches, haven't you? I think. I think all of those. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:09:46]*: They're all on YouTube. 
**Nick Love** *[01:09:48]*: Are they private? Oh, they're. I've seen a few of them. Were you, like, in your backyard and stuff? 
**Toby Potter** *[01:09:54]*: Backyard. And I've done about six videos, so. 
**Nick Love** *[01:09:57]*: I could use a lot of that. Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:10:00]*: Because there is some storytelling. 
**Nick Love** *[01:10:02]*: I know that's. I know you mentioned it. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:10:04]*: So anything. So everything I do, I have to put on YouTube to get it to Reuben and to Brenda because it's only. It'll condense it to send it. So it's all there. But, yeah, so I'm gonna go give you. I'm gonna go think of three levels of AI that I want to shoot out there, and it will be one spiritual, mental, physical, like we have already. You know what? Here's a great example. My call with Abby yesterday. 
**Nick Love** *[01:10:35]*: Really? 
**Toby Potter** *[01:10:36]*: Yeah. Yeah. That's why I flew out. 
**Nick Love** *[01:10:37]*: I thought she was out. Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:10:40]*: She says she actually paid finally. Yeah. She said, toby, I'm struggling. I'm financial. I'm struggling financially. I'm. I'm at my wits end. I've been praying and I just. I just don't know what to do. And I know you've talked about. About going through some serious financial hardships and all this. How did you. How did you get out? I said, well, I can tell you this. And I told the story of the. The $500,000 get hacked. I said, well, I'll tell you this, Abby. When were at our pinnacle, when were just running and gunning, we got hacked and somebody took $522,000 out of our account. And that was all that I had at the time. We had expanded. We had taken on this big office space. We'd taken on a bunch of overhead. I mean, were. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:11:32]*: We were running and gunning, and the cash flow was limited. And I'm telling you, I had about a half a million dollars in the bank. Somebody hacked and took it all. And I was devastated. I was pissed. I got mad. I said, and so I want you to, first and foremost, remember you're human first. When life hits you're going to react. And it's okay to react. It's okay to get upset, it's okay to get mad. But then you got to get over it. I said. And I realized that it took me. It took me about a day or two, but then I started remembering all the things that God had done for me in the past and all the trials and tribulations he brought me through and all the stresses that I had put upon myself. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:12:17]*: And then now realize that I didn't need to. Because the minute I trusted him, he delivered. So here's what you've got to do. You got to get on your knees. You've got to pray for deliverance. Except for whatever reason, whatever challenges, whatever education, you're going to accept it as a learner, as an understanding, and as an ability to teach others. Accept that is why you're going through these trials and tribulations. Then ask God to deliver you, and then you have to forget about it. Because if you ask God to deliver you and then you stress over it, you're clouding your body with the world and not giving room for God to work. So you can't have two things. You can't have all of God in you, the world in you. You have to choose. Am I going to stress? 
**Toby Potter** *[01:13:08]*: Am I going to have anxiety? Am I going to worry about this, which means I'm consumed by the world, or I release it, and then I'm consumed by God. And the minute that you're consumed by God, it allows him to work through you, remove all that and then deliver you. And you could see her just light up instantly. She says, nobody's ever told me that. I said, see, we all say, you all hear, get on your knees and pray. Get on your knees and pray. Get on your knees and pray. But see, we do that and we think like a lightning bolt, it's going to happen instantly. And then we get mad when it doesn't. We get frustrated, we get stressed, we have anxiety when it doesn't. And see, we just stopped God from working in our lives because we took back over. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:13:51]*: And you can just see so in that is, is Toby's AI number one. Now that call is recorded. No. Yeah, it is. Because we did it. Yeah. So you have that data, you have that story, you have that foundation to continue evolving, develop that. So we have that the unshakable ignite AI that can go to everybody about life. Okay. Then we'll go to the next one which would be sales overcoming objections, growing, building your platform. And then the third one is building a business through chaos. Those are the three that I see that we can be pronounced with immediately. 
**Nick Love** *[01:14:35]*: So that the bottom. If you, if we keep it within Chad GPT, it costs nothing. Right. It's still like a link to share. I don't even know. I do like talk to it and have it talk back but like a lot of the times I don't. So I mean as far as like your, I mean as far as your voice, I mean as a limitation, I. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:14:58]*: Don'T, I just, I think I it to me it loses value when there's a disconnect. 
**Nick Love** *[01:15:07]*: This is my. Yeah, I, I, I see why you say that. But for the ignite. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:15:11]*: I heard that Tony Robbins speak right back to her. It was like they were on a call. 
**Nick Love** *[01:15:18]*: But he also, I mean, I know it says like a dog, but he'll. He charges a hundred dollars a month just for that. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:15:23]*: Right. 
**Nick Love** *[01:15:24]*: For his AI. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:15:25]*: Right. 
**Nick Love** *[01:15:25]*: Only. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:15:26]*: Right. I don't even know what. He could look at the price points. Yeah, but, but when, when I saw that sample and heard his voice come back. It is if she just dialed in and got a counseling session. I know from him. Right. 
**Nick Love** *[01:15:38]*: Which is crazy. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:15:38]*: 247 personalized. Yeah. Because I'm not just getting it from an AI. I'm getting it from the guru. 
**Nick Love** *[01:15:45]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:15:45]*: Even though it is from the AI with the guru's voice, the perception and understanding and receiving of that is more profound. 
**Nick Love** *[01:15:53]*: Yeah. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:15:54]*: So does that make sense? 
**Nick Love** *[01:15:55]*: So we know it does. I'm thinking about giving that AI to people. I guess we could track it. 
**Toby Potter** *[01:16:04]*: I could do like a 5 minute is and then build a price point accordingly. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I have no problem with that. 
**Angie Potter** *[01:16:10]*: It does need to be a profit center though. 
**Nick Love** *[01:16:12]*: Yeah, well, I agree because like even right now, like technically we could probably sell the 11 labs AI one. I mean we could even. Do you have a good question? We could, we could test it and see. I'm gonna stop this recording.
