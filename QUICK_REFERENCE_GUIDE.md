## 🗣️ ELEVATOR PITCHES

### **30-Second Version**
"I help high-achieving professionals and entrepreneurs build unshakable success in faith, family, finance, and freedom. I built a real estate empire from just $600, and now I teach others the exact framework that creates prosperity without sacrifice."

### **2-Minute Version**
"You know how so many successful people feel like they're climbing the ladder but losing themselves in the process? Working 60+ hours, missing family time, questioning if this is all there is?

I solve that through The Unshakable Framework—a faith-integrated approach that helps you build success in ALL four critical areas: Faith, Family, Finance, and Freedom.

I'm not just teaching theory. I built a real estate empire from $600 while maintaining my faith, being present for my family, and living with purpose. Now through The Unshakable, I help professionals and couples create that same integrated success.

On January 15, 2026, I'm hosting The Unshakable Life Workshop featuring legendary speaker Les Brown, where we'll teach you exactly how to recalibrate your life for prosperity with purpose."

### **5-Minute Workshop Introduction**
"Good morning! I'm Toby Potter, and I want to start with a confession: Ten years ago, I was down to my last $600.

Broke. Scared. But driven by a faith that whispered 'there's more' and a family who believed in me when I struggled to believe in myself.

I faced a choice that day. I could play it safe, stay stuck, accept that maybe this was just how life was going to be. Or I could bet on myself, bet on the principles I believed in, and build something unshakable.

I chose to bet on myself. And over the next decade, I built a real estate empire. Not overnight. Not through some get-rich-quick scheme. But through consistent application of what I now call The Unshakable Framework.

But here's what's important: I didn't just build financial success. I built an UNSHAKABLE LIFE.

See, I discovered something critical along the way: Success without purpose is just sophisticated failure. You can climb the ladder of success and still lose yourself in the climb. You can build wealth but sacrifice what matters most.

That's why I developed The Unshakable Framework—a proven system for building prosperity WITH purpose. Success in Faith, Family, Finance, AND Freedom. Not sacrificing one for the other, but integrating all four.

And today, I'm joined by a legend—Les Brown—who has spent 40+ years teaching people about the greatness within them. Together, we're going to show you exactly how to build YOUR unshakable life.

Because if I can go from $600 to an empire without sacrificing what matters most, you can too. Let's get started."

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)

### **Q: What makes The Unshakable different from other coaching programs?**
A: Unlike programs that focus on business OR life, we integrate both. The Unshakable Framework addresses all four pillars—Faith, Family, Finance, and Freedom—with proven strategies, not just motivation. Plus, I've actually built what I teach: a real estate empire from $600 while maintaining unshakable faith and family foundation.

### **Q: Is this a Christian program?**
A: The Unshakable is faith-driven, founded on biblical principles, but designed for anyone seeking values-aligned success. Whether you're deeply rooted in faith or simply want your success to align with your values, this framework works. We welcome all who seek prosperity with purpose.

### **Q: I'm already successful. Is this for me?**
A: Absolutely. The Unshakable Life Workshop is specifically designed for high-achievers who are successful by external measures but struggling with fulfillment, work-life balance, or values alignment. If you're earning but exhausted, succeeding but unfulfilled, this is exactly for you.

### **Q: What will I learn at the workshop?**
A: You'll discover The Unshakable Framework for integrating faith, family, finance, and freedom. You'll learn the exact strategies I used to build from $600 to empire. You'll hear breakthrough insights from Les Brown. And you'll leave with a personalized action plan for your transformation.

### **Q: Is this just another motivational seminar?**
A: No. While you'll definitely be inspired (especially by Les Brown!), this is a strategic recalibration experience with actionable frameworks. You'll leave with a clear plan, not just temporary motivation that fades by Monday.

### **Q: Can I bring my spouse/partner?**
A: Absolutely! We encourage couples to attend together. Building unshakable prosperity as a team is powerful, and we have couples-specific pricing and content.

### **Q: What's your background? Why should I learn from you?**
A: I built a real estate empire from $600 through faith-guided principles. But more importantly, I built it WITHOUT sacrificing my family, faith, or freedom. I've coached hundreds of professionals and entrepreneurs to do the same. And on January 15, I'm partnering with legendary speaker Les Brown to bring you the ultimate transformation experience.

### **Q: What happens after the workshop?**
A: The workshop is your entry point to The Unshakable ecosystem. Depending on your needs, you can continue with The Unshakable Investor (real estate track), IGNITE (transformation community), ASCEND (mastermind), Legacy Circle (elite coaching), or private 1-on-1 coaching with me.

## 🎤 OBJECTION HANDLERS

### **Objection: "I've been to seminars before and nothing changed."**
Response: "I hear you—most seminars provide temporary motivation without actionable systems. That's why The Unshakable Life Workshop is different. You'll leave with The Unshakable Framework, a personalized action plan, and access to ongoing support through our programs. This isn't about a weekend high; it's about lasting transformation."

### **Objection: "I'm not religious/Christian."**
Response: "Perfect! While The Unshakable is faith-driven and rooted in biblical principles, we serve anyone seeking values-aligned success. Whether you're deeply rooted in faith or simply want your success to align with your personal values, this framework works. Les Brown himself serves audiences of all backgrounds with universal wisdom."

### **Objection: "I'm too busy."**
Response: "That's exactly why you need this. Feeling 'too busy' is often a symptom of the problem—working in your business or career instead of on your life. The Unshakable Framework helps you create space, not consume more time. Many of our most successful clients were 'too busy' until they discovered how to build success that includes freedom."

### **Objection: "This probably won't work for my situation."**
Response: "I understand the skepticism. But consider this: I built from $600 to empire. Our clients include real estate investors, corporate executives, business owners, couples, and solo professionals. The framework is principles-based, not situation-specific. Would you be willing to invest one day to discover if it could work for you?"

### **Objection: "I can't afford it right now."**
Response: "I appreciate your honesty. Let me ask: Can you afford to continue feeling unfulfilled, missing family time, and questioning if this is all there is? Investment in transformation isn't an expense—it's the highest ROI decision you can make. We also have payment plans available because I believe financial barriers shouldn't prevent life transformation."

### **Objection: "Why should I learn from you vs. [Tony Robbins/Grant Cardone/etc.]?"**
Response: "Great question. Those are all incredible teachers. Here's what makes The Unshakable different: I integrate faith, family, finance, AND freedom—not just business success. I've recently built what I teach (real estate empire from $600), proving it works in today's market. And I'm bringing legendary Les Brown to partner with me. If you want values-aligned, faith-integrated prosperity, this is the place."

Most high-achievers face a paradox:

The more successful they become externally, the more unfulfilled they feel internally.

Why?

Because we've been taught to optimize for ONE metric:
Financial success.

But sustainable achievement requires integration across FOUR areas:
• Faith (or values)
• Family (relationships)
• Finance (wealth)
• Freedom (time/purpose)

After building a real estate empire from $600, I discovered this the hard way.

Now I teach it through The Unshakable Framework.

On January 15, 2026, I'm partnering with legendary speaker Les Brown for The Unshakable Life Workshop—a one-day intensive on building prosperity with purpose.

This isn't another motivational seminar.
It's a strategic recalibration experience.

For professionals, entrepreneurs, and couples ready to stop choosing between success and significance.
