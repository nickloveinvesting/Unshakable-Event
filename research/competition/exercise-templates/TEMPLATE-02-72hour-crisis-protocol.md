# Exercise Template: 72-Hour Crisis Protocol
## Priority: Tier 1 (Must Include - Toby Differentiator)

**Source:** Crisis resilience educators + Toby's 2008 experience (adapted)
**Workbook Section:** Section 3 (Cashflow Management) or Section 5 (Business Building)
**Exercise Number:** 3.4 or 5.4
**Estimated Time:** 60-90 minutes (initial creation), 15 minutes (quarterly updates)
**Artifact Created:** Your Business Crisis Response Manual

---

## Exercise Purpose

This exercise creates your business's emergency response protocol—the playbook you grab when crisis hits. When markets collapse, key people quit, or cash dries up, you won't have time to think. You need pre-made decisions.

**Toby's 2008 Lesson:**

"When Lehman Brothers collapsed on September 15, 2008, I had no protocol. I scrambled. I made emotional decisions. I waited too long to cut costs. I didn't communicate fast enough with my team. By the time I knew what to do, it was too late to save Imperial Mortgage.

When I built Global Integrity Finance, I created this protocol. I review it quarterly. I've tested it twice during market corrections. It saved me. It will save you."

**The 72-Hour Window:**

Research shows the first 72 hours of a crisis determine survival. Act fast with bad information, or die slow with perfect information. Speed is currency. This protocol gives you speed.

**CRISIS PROTOCOL COMMITMENT**

I, ________________, commit to maintaining and testing my 72-Hour Crisis Protocol.

**I understand that:**
- Crises are inevitable, not hypothetical
- The first 72 hours determine survival
- Pre-made decisions are faster than real-time decisions
- This protocol is worthless if not maintained
- My business's survival depends on crisis readiness

**My Crisis Preparedness Goals:**

**Within 30 Days:**
- [ ] Complete this entire exercise
- [ ] Store protocol in secure, accessible location
- [ ] Share emergency contact info with key team members
- [ ] Test one crisis scenario with my team

**Within 90 Days:**
- [ ] Conduct full crisis drill with team
- [ ] Build 3-month cash reserve
- [ ] Train successor on decision authority
- [ ] Review protocol with business coach/mentor

**Quarterly:**
- [ ] Review and update contact information

- [ ] Test one communication template
- [ ] Check financial runway

**Annually:**
- [ ] Complete full protocol review
- [ ] Re-test all four crisis scenarios
- [ ] Update crisis definitions
- [ ] Debrief any crises that occurred

**My Accountability Partner:** ________________
**Their Role:** Check my protocol quarterly, conduct annual review with me

**Signed:** ________________

**Date:** ________________

**Next Review Date:** ________________

---

**Toby's Final Word:**

"I wish I'd built this protocol in 2003. I didn't think I needed it. We were growing. I was invincible. Then September 15, 2008 happened. Lehman Brothers collapsed. Everything fell apart. I had no plan.

When I rebuilt Global Integrity Finance, I created this protocol first—before I hired anyone, before I signed a lease, before I took a single client. I've updated it 47 times over 12 years. I've tested it in three market downturns. It saved me every time.

You don't need this protocol until you desperately need it. And when you desperately need it, you won't have time to create it. Build it now. Review it quarterly. Test it annually.

The business you save will be your own."

---

**Next Steps After Completing This Exercise:**

1. **Store this protocol securely** (digital + physical copies)
2. **Share with your emergency contact network** (Part 2)
3. **Schedule first quarterly review** (add to calendar now)
4. **Test one scenario with your team** (choose easiest scenario first)
5. **Build cash reserves** (if below 3 months runway, make this priority #1)
6. **Review with accountability partner** (within 30 days)
