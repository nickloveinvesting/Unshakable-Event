## Exercise Purpose

This exercise helps you identify and document the 5 Non-Negotiable values that define your business culture. Not aspirational corporate-speak—actual behavioral standards that determine who you hire, who you fire, and who you promote.

**Why 5 Non-Negotiables Matter:**

Most businesses have 8-12 "core values" plastered on their walls that nobody remembers or follows. Toby's approach: If you have 10 values, you have zero. Pick 5. Make them observable. Make them enforceable. Make them non-negotiable.

**Toby's Story:**

"In 2008, when the financial crisis hit and I had to cut Imperial Mortgage from 35 loan officers down to a skeleton crew, I learned something critical: the people who stayed and helped me rebuild weren't necessarily the most talented or experienced. They were the ones who shared my non-negotiables.

They showed up when things were hardest. They told the truth even when it hurt. They took ownership instead of making excuses. They moved fast instead of overthinking. They cared about the clients even when there was no commission coming.

Those 5 behaviors—that's what saved the business. When I rebuilt Global Integrity Finance, I made those 5 behaviors non-negotiable from day one. Now I hire for them, fire for violations of them, and promote based on them. Culture isn't a poster on the wall. It's who you keep and who you cut."

## Part 1: Non-Negotiables vs. Core Values (The Toby Distinction)

**Instructions:** Understand the difference before you begin.

### The Problem with "Core Values"

**Traditional Corporate Values:**
- Too many (8-12 values nobody remembers)
- Too abstract ("integrity," "excellence," "innovation")
- Not behavioral (can't observe or measure)
- Not enforced (violators kept because they perform)
- Aspirational, not actual

**Examples You've Seen:**
- "We value integrity" → but top salesperson lies to clients
- "We value teamwork" → but rockstar keeps all information to himself
- "We value innovation" → but new ideas get shut down in meetings

### Toby's 5 Non-Negotiables Approach

**What Makes Them Different:**

1. **Exactly 5** (more = dilution, fewer = insufficient)
2. **Observable behaviors** (you can see them or not see them)
3. **Actually enforced** (violations = termination, even if performer)
4. **Hiring filter** (screen candidates against these)
5. **Crisis-tested** (these survived 2008, not aspirational theory)

**Your Non-Negotiables Should Answer:**
- When everything's on fire, what behaviors do you demand?
- Who would you keep in a 2008-style collapse?
- What violations would make you fire your top producer?
- What behaviors separate your best people from the rest?

## Part 2: Excavation Process (Discovering Your Actual 5)

**Instructions:** Don't invent aspirational values. Discover what you actually care about.

### Excavation Question 1: Your Best People

**Think of your 3 best employees/contractors/partners you've ever worked with.**

**Person 1:** ________________________________________

**What behaviors did they consistently demonstrate?**
1. ________________________________________
2. ________________________________________
3. ________________________________________

**Person 2:** ________________________________________

**What behaviors did they consistently demonstrate?**
1. ________________________________________
2. ________________________________________
3. ________________________________________

**Person 3:** ________________________________________

**What behaviors did they consistently demonstrate?**
1. ________________________________________
2. ________________________________________
3. ________________________________________

**Common Patterns (circle behaviors that appeared 2+ times):**

________________________________________
________________________________________
________________________________________

---

### Excavation Question 2: Your Worst Hire/Fire

**Think of the worst person you hired or had to fire.**

**Person:** ________________________________________

**What behaviors led to their failure/termination?**
1. ________________________________________
2. ________________________________________
3. ________________________________________

**What was the opposite behavior you wished they had?**
1. ________________________________________
2. ________________________________________
3. ________________________________________

**Lesson:** Often your non-negotiables become clear when you see violations.

---

### Excavation Question 3: Crisis Behavior Analysis

**Toby's 2008 Test:** "Who stayed? What did they do?"

**Your Crisis (or hypothetical 2008-style scenario):**

If your revenue dropped 50% tomorrow and you could only keep 3 people:

**Person 1 you'd keep:** ________________
**Why (specific behaviors):** ________________________________________

**Person 2 you'd keep:** ________________
**Why (specific behaviors):** ________________________________________

**Person 3 you'd keep:** ________________
**Why (specific behaviors):** ________________________________________

**Common behaviors of your "keepers":**
________________________________________
________________________________________
________________________________________

---

### Excavation Question 4: Your Personal Operating System

**When you're at your best, what behaviors do YOU demonstrate?**

1. ________________________________________
2. ________________________________________
3. ________________________________________
4. ________________________________________
5. ________________________________________

**When you're frustrated with someone on your team, what specific behavior are they violating?**

1. ________________________________________
2. ________________________________________
3. ________________________________________

**Insight:** Your non-negotiables often reflect how YOU operate when you're performing at peak.

---

### Consolidation: Your Candidate Non-Negotiables

**Instructions:** Review all excavation questions. Identify 5-8 behavioral patterns that keep appearing.

**Pattern 1:** ________________________________________
**Pattern 2:** ________________________________________
**Pattern 3:** ________________________________________
**Pattern 4:** ________________________________________
**Pattern 5:** ________________________________________
**Pattern 6:** ________________________________________
**Pattern 7:** ________________________________________
**Pattern 8:** ________________________________________

**Now narrow to 5.** (If you can't narrow down, you haven't gone deep enough. Force the choice.)

**Your 5 Non-Negotiables (Draft):**

1. ________________________________________
2. ________________________________________
3. ________________________________________
4. ________________________________________
5. ________________________________________

---

## Part 4: Hiring Integration

**Instructions:** Turn your 5 Non-Negotiables into a hiring filter.

### Interview Questions Per Non-Negotiable

**For Each of Your 5 Non-Negotiables, Create 2-3 Interview Questions:**

### Candidate Scorecard

**Instructions:** During interviews, score candidates 1-5 on each non-negotiable.

| Non-Negotiable | Score (1-5) | Evidence/Notes |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1. ______________ | _____ | ________________ |
| 2. ______________ | _____ | ________________ |
| 3. ______________ | _____ | ________________ |
| 4. ______________ | _____ | ________________ |
| 5. ______________ | _____ | ________________ |
| **TOTAL** | **_____/25** | |

**Hiring Threshold:**
- 20-25 = Strong hire (culture fit + competence)
- 15-19 = Maybe (competence without culture = danger)
- Below 15 = Pass (no matter how talented)

**Toby's Principle:** "Hire slow (culture fit first), fire fast (violations immediate)."

---

## Part 5: Firing Criteria

**Instructions:** Define which violations require immediate termination vs. coaching.

### Zero-Tolerance Violations

**For each non-negotiable, identify violations that = immediate termination (no warnings):**

**Non-Negotiable #1: ________________**
**Zero-Tolerance Violation:**
________________________________________
**Why no second chance:**
________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #2: ________________**
**Zero-Tolerance Violation:**
________________________________________
**Why no second chance:**
________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #3: ________________**
**Zero-Tolerance Violation:**
________________________________________
**Why no second chance:**
________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #4: ________________**
**Zero-Tolerance Violation:**
________________________________________
**Why no second chance:**
________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #5: ________________**
**Zero-Tolerance Violation:**

**Why no second chance:**
________________________________________

---

### Warning System (Minor Violations)

________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #3: ________________**
**Minor Violation:**
________________________________________
**Coaching Response:**
________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #4: ________________**
**Minor Violation:**
________________________________________
**Coaching Response:**
________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #5: ________________**
**Minor Violation:**
________________________________________
**Coaching Response:**
________________________________________

---

**Toby's Tough Love:** "If your top producer violates a non-negotiable and you don't fire them, you just told everyone else your 'values' are negotiable. You destroyed your culture to keep one person. That's how you lose your best people."

---

## Part 6: Onboarding & Performance Review Integration

**Instructions:** Weave non-negotiables into every people system.

### New Hire Onboarding (Day 1)

**Onboarding Script:**

"Welcome to [Company Name]. Before we talk about your role, let's talk about how we operate.

**Our 5 Non-Negotiables are:**
1. ________________________________________
2. ________________________________________
3. ________________________________________
4. ________________________________________
5. ________________________________________

**Here's what they mean in practice:**
[Insert 1-2 sentence explanation per non-negotiable]

**Here's what happens if you violate them:**
[Insert consequences—warnings vs. immediate termination]

**Questions about our culture before we start?**"

**Document to Provide:**
- [ ] Printed 5 Non-Negotiables document
- [ ] Story examples for each non-negotiable
- [ ] Signature page acknowledging cultural expectations

---

### 90-Day New Hire Review

**Instructions:** Assess new hire against each non-negotiable.

**New Hire Name:** ________________
**Review Date:** ________________

| Non-Negotiable | Score (1-5) | Evidence/Examples | Keep/Cut? |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 1. ______________ | _____ | __________________ | _____ |
| 2. ______________ | _____ | __________________ | _____ |
| 3. ______________ | _____ | __________________ | _____ |
| 4. ______________ | _____ | __________________ | _____ |
| 5. ______________ | _____ | __________________ | _____ |
| **TOTAL** | **_____/25** | | |

**Decision Criteria:**
- 20-25 = Keep, invest in training
- 15-19 = Probation, specific coaching plan
- Below 15 = Cut now (wrong culture fit)

**Decision:** [ ] Keep [ ] Probation [ ] Terminate

---

- 70-79 = Meeting expectations
- Below 70 = Performance improvement plan or termination

**Toby's Promotion Rule:** "To get promoted, you must score 45+ on culture (90%+) AND 40+ on role (80%+). We promote culture carriers first, individual contributors second."

---

---

## Part 8: Crisis Testing

**Instructions:** Toby's 2008 lesson—only crisis reveals if culture is real.

### Crisis Scenario 1: Revenue Drops 50%

**Situation:** Your business loses half its revenue in 30 days. You must cut team size in half.

**Question 1:** Using only your 5 Non-Negotiables as criteria, who would you keep?

**Person 1 (Keep):** ________________
**Why (which non-negotiables they exemplify):**
________________________________________

**Person 2 (Keep):** ________________
**Why:**
________________________________________

**Person 3 (Keep):** ________________
**Why:**
________________________________________

**Question 2:** Who would you cut, even if they're high performers?

**Person 1 (Cut):** ________________
**Why (which non-negotiables they violate):**
________________________________________

---

### Crisis Scenario 2: Your Top Producer Violates a Non-Negotiable

**Situation:** Your #1 revenue generator (30% of company income) clearly violates one of your non-negotiables.

**Which non-negotiable did they violate?** ________________

**What specifically did they do?**
________________________________________
________________________________________

**Your decision:**
[ ] Fire them immediately (culture > revenue)
[ ] Give them one warning
[ ] Let it slide (too valuable to lose)

**If you checked anything other than "fire immediately":**

**Toby's Question:** "Why is this value called 'non-negotiable' if you just negotiated it away for money?"

**Real Decision:** ________________

**What This Reveals About Your Actual Culture:**
________________________________________
________________________________________

---

### Crisis Scenario 3: New Hire Shows Red Flags

**Situation:** 30 days into employment, new hire shows concerning pattern against Non-Negotiable #___.

**Specific behaviors observed:**
1. ________________________________________
2. ________________________________________
3. ________________________________________

**Your 90-day decision:**
[ ] Keep and coach (benefit of doubt)
[ ] Probation with specific improvement plan
[ ] Terminate now (wrong fit, cut losses fast)

**Toby's Principle:** "Hire slow, fire fast. The longer you wait to fire a culture violator, the more damage they do and the harder it gets to pull the trigger."

---

### Anti-Fragility Test

**Question:** Do your 5 Non-Negotiables make your business STRONGER during crisis, or just help you survive?

**For Each Non-Negotiable, Answer:**

**Non-Negotiable #1: ________________**
[ ] Helps survive crisis
[ ] Makes us stronger from crisis (anti-fragile)
**How:** ________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #2: ________________**
[ ] Helps survive crisis
[ ] Makes us stronger from crisis
**How:** ________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #3: ________________**
[ ] Helps survive crisis
[ ] Makes us stronger from crisis
**How:** ________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #4: ________________**
[ ] Helps survive crisis
[ ] Makes us stronger from crisis
**How:** ________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #5: ________________**
[ ] Helps survive crisis
[ ] Makes us stronger from crisis
**How:** ________________________________________

**Toby's Standard:** "If your culture only helps you survive crisis, it's not anti-fragile. Real culture gets STRONGER when tested. The 2008 collapse didn't reveal my culture—it CREATED it."

---

**5 NON-NEGOTIABLES CULTURE COMMITMENT**

I, ________________, commit to building a business culture defined by these 5 Non-Negotiable behaviors:

**Non-Negotiable #1:**
________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #2:**
________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #3:**
________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #4:**
________________________________________

**Non-Negotiable #5:**

**I understand that:**
- These are the behaviors I will hire for
- These are the behaviors I will fire violations of
- These are the behaviors I will promote based on
- These are crisis-tested, not aspirational
- I will review these quarterly and revise annually
- I will teach these through stories, not posters

**I commit to:**
- Refusing to hire candidates who don't demonstrate these, no matter how talented
- Terminating employees who violate these, no matter how much revenue they generate
- Leading by example and demonstrating these behaviors myself
- Holding myself accountable to the same standard I demand from my team

**If I compromise these non-negotiables for convenience or revenue, I forfeit the right to call them "non-negotiable."**

**Signed:** ________________

**Date:** ________________

**My Accountability Partner:** ________________
(Someone who will check my culture decisions quarterly)

**Date to Share with Team:** ________________

**Toby's Final Word:**

"Amanda was my first hire at Imperial Mortgage in 1999. She wasn't the most experienced loan officer. She wasn't the smoothest talker. But she showed up early, told me the truth even when I didn't want to hear it, took ownership of problems instead of blaming others, moved fast on opportunities, and cared about clients like they were family.

When 2008 hit and I lost nearly everything, Amanda stayed. She didn't have to. She chose to.

When I rebuilt Global Integrity Finance, I didn't look for the most talented people. I looked for more Amandas. People who embodied those 5 behaviors—because those behaviors are what survive crisis.

Your 5 Non-Negotiables aren't about creating a 'nice' culture. They're about creating a SURVIVING culture. When the next 2008 hits your business—and it will—your culture is what determines whether you rebuild or quit.

Make your 5 non-negotiable. Fire fast when they're violated. Promote hard when they're exemplified. That's how you build an Unshakable Empire."

---
