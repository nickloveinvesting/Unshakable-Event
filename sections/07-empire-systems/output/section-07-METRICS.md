## Notes for Editor

### Word Count Flexibility
- Current count (~14,850) is at the upper-middle of target range
- If expansion needed: Part 3 (Operating Agreements) could be expanded with more examples
- If reduction needed: Some framework explanations in Parts 1-2 could be condensed

### Balance Assessment
- Theory vs. practical: ~40% framework explanation, ~60% practical application
- Story vs. instruction: ~15% narrative, ~85% instruction
- Individual vs. organizational focus: Appropriate progression through section

### Comparison to Previous Sections
- Section 1: ~8,000 words (shorter, identity-focused)
- Section 2: ~10,500 words (medium, habit-focused)
- Section 3: ~9,500 words (medium, financial-focused)
- Section 7: ~14,850 words (longer, synthesis section - appropriate given scope)

Section 7's increased length is appropriate given its synthesis role and the number of frameworks it introduces.
