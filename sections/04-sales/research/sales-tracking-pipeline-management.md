## Core Frameworks

### 1. Sales Metrics Glossary

Understanding what to measure is the foundation of sales management. Here are the essential metrics every sales professional should track:

#### Revenue & Growth Metrics (Lagging Indicators)

| Metric | Definition | Formula | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Revenue** | Total income from sales | Sum of closed deals | Ultimate scoreboard |
| **Average Deal Size** | Typical value per closed deal | Total revenue / Number of deals | Guides targeting and forecasting |
| **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** | Predictable monthly income | Sum of all monthly subscriptions | Subscription business health |
| **Annual Contract Value (ACV)** | Yearly value of contracts | Annual subscription value | Long-term revenue planning |

#### Pipeline Health Metrics (Leading Indicators)

| Metric | Definition | Formula | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Pipeline Value** | Total value of active opportunities | Sum of all deal values in pipeline | Forecasting potential |
| **Pipeline Coverage** | Multiple of pipeline to quota | Pipeline value / Quota target | Indicates if enough opportunities exist |
| **Number of Deals** | Count of active opportunities | Count of open deals | Activity level indicator |
| **Stage Distribution** | How deals spread across stages | % of deals per stage | Identifies bottlenecks |

**Pipeline Coverage Benchmark:** 3x coverage recommended (if quota is $100K, maintain $300K in pipeline)

#### Sales Efficiency Metrics (Process Metrics)

| Metric | Definition | Formula | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Conversion Rate** | % moving from one stage to next | (Moved to next stage / Total at previous stage) × 100 | Identifies weak points |
| **Win Rate / Close Rate** | % of deals won | (Won deals / Total deals) × 100 | Overall effectiveness |
| **Sales Cycle Length** | Time from first contact to close | Average days to close | Predictability and forecasting |
| **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)** | Total cost to acquire customer | Total sales & marketing cost / New customers | Efficiency measure |

**Win Rate Calculation Example:**
- 50 leads worked
- 20 deals closed
- Win Rate = 20/50 = 40%

#### Activity & Velocity Metrics (Execution Metrics)

| Metric | Definition | Formula | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Pipeline Velocity** | Speed of revenue through pipeline | (Deals × Avg Deal Size × Win Rate) / Sales Cycle Length | Comprehensive performance measure |
| **Activities Per Day** | Calls, emails, meetings | Count of touchpoints | Effort indicator |
| **Lead Response Time** | Time to first contact | Minutes/hours from inquiry to response | Speed to lead affects conversion |
| **Follow-Up Rate** | Consistency of follow-through | Follow-ups completed / Required | Persistence measure |

**Pipeline Velocity Formula:**
```
Pipeline Velocity = (Number of Opportunities × Average Deal Size × Win Rate) / Sales Cycle Length (days)
```

**Example:**
- 50 opportunities
- $10,000 average deal
- 25% win rate
- 30-day sales cycle

Pipeline Velocity = (50 × $10,000 × 0.25) / 30 = **$4,167/day**

### 2. Key Performance Benchmarks (2024)

| Metric | Industry Average | Top Performers |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Win Rate** | 20-25% | 35-45% |
| **Sales Cycle (B2B)** | 3-6 months | 2-3 months |
| **Pipeline Coverage** | 2-3x | 4-5x |
| **Lead Response Time** | 5-24 hours | Under 5 minutes |
| **Email Response Rate** | 8-12% | 15-25% |
| **Quota Attainment** | 50-60% | 80-100% |

**Critical Finding (Xactly Insights, 2024):** 70% of B2B sales reps missed quota in 2024.

**Success Correlation (Sales Management Association):**
- Teams tracking 5-7 core KPIs: 91% average quota attainment
- Teams tracking 0-3 metrics: 73% average quota attainment

### 3. Pipeline Stages & Visualization

#### Standard B2B Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Description | Conversion Focus | Exit Criteria |
|-------|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| **1. Prospecting** | Identifying potential customers | Building initial list | Contact information verified |
| **2. Qualification** | Assessing fit, need, budget, authority | BANT criteria | Qualified or disqualified |
| **3. Meeting/Demo** | Presentation of solution | Value demonstration | Interest confirmed |
| **4. Proposal** | Formal offer with pricing | Terms negotiation | Proposal accepted or revised |
| **5. Negotiation** | Final terms discussion | Objection handling | Agreement on terms |
| **6. Closed Won/Lost** | Deal completed or lost | Contract signed or reason documented | Revenue booked or loss analyzed |

#### Pipeline Visualization Template

```
PROSPECTING → QUALIFIED → MEETING → PROPOSAL → NEGOTIATION → CLOSED
    │             │           │          │            │           │
   100           60          40         25           15          10
  (100%)       (60%)       (40%)      (25%)        (15%)       (10%)
```

**Pipeline Health Indicators:**

| Indicator | Healthy Sign | Warning Sign |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Stage Distribution** | Bell curve (most deals mid-pipeline) | Top-heavy (stuck at early stages) |
| **Deal Movement** | Regular advancement | Deals stalled 30+ days |
| **Age of Deals** | Within average cycle | Many over 2x average cycle |
| **Coverage Ratio** | 3x+ of quota | Under 2x of quota |

#### Pipeline Review Cadence

|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Daily** | Activities completed, immediate priorities | Update CRM, plan next day |
| **Weekly** | Deal advancement, stuck deals | Move or remove stalled opportunities |
| **Monthly** | Conversion rates, pipeline health | Adjust strategies, update forecasts |
| **Quarterly** | Win/loss analysis, process improvement | Refine stages, train on gaps |

### 4. CRM Tool Recommendations

#### For Solopreneurs & Small Teams

| CRM | Best For | Price Point | Key Features | Limitations |
|-----|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **HubSpot Free** | Getting started | Free | Contact management, email tracking, basic pipeline | Limited automation |
| **HubSpot Starter** | Growing solopreneur | ~$50/month | Automation, sequences, more features | Costs add up with growth |
| **Go High Level** | Agencies, service businesses | $97-297/month | All-in-one marketing + CRM, unlimited contacts | Less mature than HubSpot |

| **Scaling ($500K+)** | HubSpot Professional or Salesforce | Advanced features, integrations |

### 5. Building a Predictable Sales Pipeline

#### The Predictable Revenue Model

**Core Principle:** Revenue becomes predictable when the process generating it is systematic and measurable.

**Key Components:**

| Component | Description | Outcome |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Defined Stages** | Clear criteria for each pipeline stage | Consistent progression |
| **Consistent Metrics** | Same KPIs tracked across team | Comparable performance |
| **Regular Reviews** | Weekly/monthly pipeline analysis | Continuous improvement |
| **Historical Data** | Conversion rates by stage | Accurate forecasting |
| **Clean Data** | Up-to-date, accurate CRM records | Reliable insights |

**Formula for Forecast Accuracy:**
```
Forecasted Revenue = Pipeline Value × Historical Win Rate × Confidence Adjustment
```

#### Pipeline Data Hygiene

**Alarming Statistics:**
- 91% of CRM data is incomplete
- 70% of CRM data goes bad yearly
- 25% of pipeline that hasn't moved in a month is effectively dead

**Data Hygiene Best Practices:**

| Practice | Frequency | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Update deal stages** | Daily | Accurate pipeline snapshot |
| **Add notes after interactions** | After each contact | Context for follow-ups |
| **Remove/archive stalled deals** | Weekly | Realistic pipeline view |
| **Verify contact information** | Monthly | Reduce bounces, reach right people |
| **Full pipeline audit** | Quarterly | Eliminate dead weight |

**Stalled Deal Policy:**
- 30 days without movement: Review and re-engage or move to "stalled"
- 60 days without movement: Move to "lost" or archive
- Exception: Document explicitly if long sales cycle is expected

### 6. Follow-Up Frameworks

#### The Power of Follow-Up

**Research Finding:** 80% of sales require 5+ follow-up contacts, but 44% of salespeople give up after one.

**Follow-Up Success Rates:**
| Touch Point | Cumulative Response Rate |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| 1st attempt | 2-3% |
| 2nd attempt | 5-7% |
| 3rd attempt | 8-12% |
| 4th attempt | 12-18% |
| 5th attempt | 20-25% |
| 6th+ attempt | 25-30% |

#### The 1-3-7-30 Follow-Up Framework

A structured approach to maintaining contact without overwhelming prospects:

| Day | Action | Channel | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|---------|
| **Day 1** | Initial follow-up | Email | Thank them, recap conversation |
| **Day 3** | Value-add | Email/LinkedIn | Share relevant resource |
| **Day 7** | Check-in | Phone | Personal touch, gauge interest |
| **Day 14** | Educational | Email | Industry insight, case study |
| **Day 21** | Direct ask | Phone/Email | Move to next step |
| **Day 30** | Last touch | Email | "Breakup" email or long-term nurture |

#### Multi-Channel Cadence Template

**For Warm Leads (Inbound):**

| Day | Channel | Content Focus |
|-----|---------|---------------|
| 0 | Phone | Immediate response (within 5 minutes ideal) |
| 0 | Email | If no answer, follow-up with context |
| 1 | Email | Value proposition + meeting offer |
| 2 | LinkedIn | Connection request + note |
| 3 | Phone | Try again + voicemail |
| 5 | Email | Social proof / case study |
| 7 | Phone | Final attempt |
| 7 | Email | Alternative next steps |

**For Cold Leads (Outbound):**

| Day | Channel | Content Focus |
|-----|---------|---------------|
| 1 | Email | Personalized introduction + insight |
| 3 | LinkedIn | Connect + engage with their content |
| 5 | Email | Follow-up with different value angle |
| 7 | Phone | First call attempt |
| 9 | Email | Case study relevant to their industry |
| 12 | Phone | Second call attempt |
| 14 | Email | Direct ask or alternative |
| 18 | Email | "Breakup" email |

#### Follow-Up Best Practices

**Timing:**
- Decision makers engage most between 3-6 PM
- Thursday and Friday often have better response rates
- Send emails 5 minutes before or after the hour
- Respond to inbound leads within 5 minutes when possible

**Spacing:**
- Space touchpoints 2-3 days apart
- Don't overwhelm with daily contacts
- Cold leads need more time than warm leads
- After "breakup" email, follow up once per quarter

**Content:**
- Each touch should provide new value
- Don't just ask "checking in"—give a reason
- Personalize based on their industry, role, or recent activity
- Mix channels for maximum visibility

**Technology:**
- Use CRM sequences/automation for consistency
- Set reminders for manual touches
- Track open rates and engagement
- A/B test subject lines and content

#### Sample Follow-Up Email Templates

**Day 1 Follow-Up:**
```
Subject: Next steps from our conversation

Hi [Name],

Great speaking with you about [specific topic discussed].

As promised, here's [resource/information mentioned].

Based on what you shared about [their challenge], I think we could help you [specific outcome].

Would [day/time] work for a quick call to explore this further?

[Your name]
```

**Day 7 Value-Add:**
```
Subject: Thought this might help with [their challenge]

Hi [Name],

I came across this [article/case study/resource] and immediately thought of your situation with [specific challenge].

[Brief insight from the resource]

Curious if this resonates with what you're experiencing?

[Your name]
```

**Day 14+ "Breakup" Email:**
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back, which usually means one of three things:

1. You're happy with your current approach
2. The timing isn't right
3. You've been abducted by aliens (hoping it's not this one)

If now isn't the right time, no problem—I'll follow up in a few months. But if something's changed or there's a better way I can help, I'm all ears.

Either way, wishing you success.

[Your name]
```

## Toby Integration Points

### Connection to IGNITE Framework

| Toby's Principle | Pipeline Application |
|------------------|---------------------|
| **"Speed is Currency"** | Respond to leads fast; follow up consistently |
| **"Daily Disciplines Compound"** | Daily CRM updates, consistent prospecting |
| **"If It's Going to Be, It's Up to Me"** | Own your pipeline; don't wait for leads |
| **"Identity Before Results"** | Track behaviors (inputs) not just outcomes |
| **"Vision Must Be Bigger Than You"** | Pipeline supports long-term revenue goals |

### Why Tracking Supports Integrity-First Sales

1. **Data reveals truth:** You can't hide from numbers. Tracking forces honest assessment.

2. **Systematic follow-up = service:** Consistent follow-up isn't pushy—it's professional.

3. **Pipeline hygiene = respect:** Removing dead deals shows respect for your own time and energy.

4. **Forecasting = reliability:** Accurate forecasts build trust with partners, investors, family.

5. **Metrics identify problems early:** You can fix what you can see.

### Toby's Pipeline Philosophy

**"You can't manage what you don't measure. But you also can't let metrics make you forget you're serving people, not just closing deals."**

**Balance Points:**
- Track conversion rates, but don't forget human connection
- Follow up systematically, but stay genuine
- Review pipeline health, but also review relationship health
- Forecast revenue, but also forecast impact

## Recommended Exercises

### Exercise 1: Metric Dashboard Creation

**Purpose:** Build your personal sales tracking system
**Time:** 90 minutes

**Method:**
1. Choose 5-7 core KPIs from the metrics glossary
2. Create a simple dashboard (spreadsheet or CRM dashboard)
3. For each metric, define:
   - How you'll measure it
   - Your current baseline
   - Your target
   - Review frequency
4. Set up weekly review calendar reminder
5. Track for 4 weeks; adjust metrics as needed

**Starter Dashboard:**
| Metric | Current | Target | This Week | This Month |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Pipeline Value | | | | |

### Exercise 2: Pipeline Health Audit

**Purpose:** Assess and clean up your current pipeline
**Time:** 60 minutes

**Method:**
1. Export or review all current pipeline deals
2. For each deal, assess:
   - Last contact date (over 30 days = stalled)
   - Clear next step? (If not, add one or remove deal)
   - Realistic close date? (Adjust if needed)
   - Correct stage? (Move if criteria met/unmet)
3. Calculate true pipeline coverage (excluding stalled deals)
4. Archive or close deals that are truly dead
5. Identify top 5 deals to prioritize this week

**Audit Questions:**
- [ ] Has this deal moved in 30 days?
- [ ] Do I have a clear next action?
- [ ] Is my contact still engaged?
- [ ] Is my close date realistic?
- [ ] Would I bet money on this closing?

### Exercise 3: CRM Setup or Optimization

   - Number of touchpoints
   - Channels used
   - Timing between touches
   - Content theme per touch
3. Write 3 email templates for each cadence
4. Set up sequences in your CRM
5. Test with real leads
6. Measure response rates; iterate

**Cadence Template:**
```
Lead Source: _______________
Total Touches: _______________
Duration: _______________ days
