### How Did Toby Finance Deals in 2000s vs. Post-2008?

**Pre-2008 Environment (Easy Money Era):**
- Stated income loans ("liar loans") readily available
- 100% financing common
- Credit standards loose
- Appreciation expected to cover mistakes
- Private money less necessary—banks would fund almost anything

**Post-2008 Environment (Tight Credit Era):**
- Dodd-Frank regulations tightened lending
- Full documentation required
- 20-25% down payments standard for investment
- Debt-to-income ratios scrutinized
- Private money became essential for investors

**Toby's Adaptation:**
"After 2008, the game changed completely. Banks weren't lending to investors like before. That's when I doubled down on private lending relationships and creative structures. The investors who thrived were those who could fund deals without depending on banks. Those who couldn't adapt lost their portfolios."

### What Financing Strategies Work in Tight Credit Markets?

**When Banks Say No:**

1. **Private Money Networks**
   - Self-directed IRA investors seeking returns
   - High-net-worth individuals tired of stock market volatility
   - Former real estate investors who prefer passive returns
   - Business owners with excess cash

2. **Seller Financing**
   - Motivated sellers who need monthly income
   - Sellers with high capital gains tax exposure
   - Sellers of properties that don't qualify for conventional financing
   - Estate sales where heirs want cash flow, not lump sum

3. **Subject-To Existing Financing**
   - Sellers behind on payments willing to walk away
   - Sellers with low-interest rate mortgages worth preserving
   - Distressed situations where formal assumption isn't possible

4. **Hard Money (Higher Cost, Fast Access)**
   - When speed matters more than cost
   - Properties that won't qualify for conventional
   - Bridge situations until refinance possible

### How Do You Structure Deals with Zero Money Down?

**The Zero-Down Framework:**

**Option 1: Seller Financing with No Down**
```
Purchase Price: $150,000
Seller carries: $150,000 at 6% for 30 years
Your out-of-pocket: $0 (plus closing costs)
Monthly payment: ~$899
Works when: Seller owns free and clear, needs income stream
```

**Option 2: Subject-To + Private Second**
```
Purchase Price: $180,000
Existing mortgage: $140,000 (take subject-to)
Private second: $40,000 + closing costs
Your out-of-pocket: $0
Works when: Seller motivated, existing loan has good terms
```

**Option 3: Hard Money 100% + Private Rehab**
```
Purchase Price: $100,000
Hard money: $100,000 (100% LTV on distressed properties)
Private money: $40,000 rehab funds
Your out-of-pocket: $0 (plus points/fees)
Works when: Deal is strong enough to secure multiple lenders
```

**Option 4: Partnership/Equity Split**
```
Purchase Price: $200,000
Partner provides: $50,000 down + closing
You provide: Deal finding, management, expertise
Split: 50/50 on profits
Your out-of-pocket: $0
Works when: You have deal flow, partner has capital
```

**Critical Warning from Toby:**
"Zero-down deals are possible but require either strong relationships or exceptional deals. Never use 'zero down' as a crutch for poor analysis. The deal must work even with money in it. Zero-down is a tool for capital efficiency, not for buying deals that don't otherwise make sense."

### Integration with Toby's Global Integrity Finance Model

**Core Principle:** Build a financing ecosystem that doesn't depend on any single source

**The Three-Legged Stool:**

- Add hard money lender relationships for speed
- Build bank relationships for refinance/hold strategies
- Develop seller financing skills for motivated seller situations

### 3. Hard Money Lending Guide

#### What Is Hard Money?

Hard money loans are asset-based, short-term loans secured by real property. Lenders focus on the deal (the asset) rather than the borrower's personal financial situation. They're the "fast money" of real estate investing.

#### Typical Hard Money Terms (2024-2025)

| Term | Typical Range |
|------|---------------|
| Interest Rate | 10-15% |
| Points (Origination) | 2-4 points |
| Loan-to-Value (LTV) | 60-75% of ARV |
| Loan-to-Cost (LTC) | 80-90% of purchase |
| Term | 6-18 months |
| Extension Fee | 1-2 points |
| Prepayment Penalty | Often none, sometimes 1-3 months |
| Rehab Disbursement | Draw system or upfront |

#### Red Flags in Hard Money Lending

**Avoid Lenders Who:**
- Require large upfront deposits before commitment
- Won't provide clear written terms
- Have no physical office or online presence
- Promise "guaranteed approval" regardless of deal
- Charge excessive fees beyond industry norms
- Have poor reviews or Better Business Bureau complaints
- Won't provide references from other investors

**Questions to Ask Hard Money Lenders:**

1. What are your current rates, points, and fees?
2. What is your typical closing timeline?
3. What is your maximum LTV and LTC?
4. Do you fund rehab? How are draws handled?
5. What is your extension policy and fee?
6. Is there a prepayment penalty?
7. What experience level do you require?
8. Can you provide references from recent borrowers?
9. What documentation do you need?
10. What happens if I can't pay off on time?

### 4. Private Money Lending Framework

#### What Is Private Money?

Private money comes from individuals rather than institutions. These are typically:
- High-net-worth individuals seeking better returns than bank CDs
- Self-directed IRA holders wanting real estate exposure without management
- Retired professionals with cash reserves
- Business owners with excess working capital
- Friends and family (with proper documentation)

#### Why People Lend Private Money

| Lender Motivation | What They Seek |
|-------------------|----------------|
| **Better Returns** | 8-12% vs. 4-5% bank savings |
| **Security** | Real estate collateral vs. stock volatility |
| **Passive Income** | Monthly payments without landlord duties |
| **Diversification** | Alternative to traditional investments |
| **Control** | Choose which deals to fund |
| **Simplicity** | Clear terms, secured position |

### 5. Creative Financing Strategies

#### A. Seller Financing

**How It Works:**
The seller acts as the bank. Instead of paying the seller cash at closing (which you'd get from a bank), the seller carries a note and you make payments directly to them.

**Typical Seller Financing Terms:**

| Term | Typical Range |
|------|---------------|
| Down Payment | 5-20% (negotiable) |
| Interest Rate | 5-8% (often below bank rates) |
| Term | 5-30 years (balloon common) |
| Amortization | 20-30 years |
| Balloon | Often 5-7 years |

**Best Seller Financing Candidates:**

- Sellers who own property free and clear
- Sellers wanting installment sale for tax benefits
- Sellers who can't sell conventionally (property condition)
- Estate sales where heirs want ongoing income
- Retiring landlords who want income without management
- Sellers facing capital gains tax issues

**Seller Financing Pitch Script:**

"I noticed your property has been on market for [X] days. I'm an investor, and I'm wondering if you'd consider owner financing? Here's why it might work for you:

1. You'd get a higher price (I can pay above asking)
2. You'd get steady monthly income (like being a landlord without headaches)
3. You'd spread out your capital gains tax (installment sale treatment)
4. If I don't pay, you get the property back PLUS keep everything I've paid

Would that be something worth exploring?"

#### B. Subject-To Existing Financing

**How It Works:**
You purchase the property "subject to" the existing mortgage. The loan stays in the seller's name, but you take ownership and make the payments. The seller is relieved of the property; you get the benefit of their existing loan terms.

**Why Sellers Agree:**
- Behind on payments and facing foreclosure
- Need to relocate quickly
- Underwater (owe more than value)
- Divorce situations
- Death/estate situations
- Tired landlords

**Subject-To Mechanics:**

```
SELLER'S SITUATION:
Property Value: $200,000
Existing Mortgage: $180,000 at 3.5%
Seller's Equity: $20,000
Monthly Payment: $808

SUBJECT-TO ACQUISITION:
You pay seller: $5,000 (for their equity + motivation)
You take over: $180,000 mortgage (stay in seller's name)
Your cost: $5,000 + closing costs

YOUR BENEFIT:
- 3.5% interest rate (vs. 7.5% market rate)
- Payment: $808/month (vs. $1,259 if you refinanced)
- Monthly savings: $451
- Annual savings: $5,412
```

**Critical Subject-To Considerations:**

1. **Due-on-Sale Clause:** Most mortgages have this. Bank CAN call loan due if they discover transfer. Risk exists but is rarely exercised on performing loans.

2. **Insurance:** Must maintain hazard insurance. Structure carefully with attorney guidance.

3. **Trust Protection:** Often done with land trust for additional protection.

4. **Seller Protection:** Seller remains on loan until you refinance or sell. Document everything.

5. **Exit Strategy:** Plan to refinance within 2-5 years or sell property.

**Subject-To Risk Mitigation:**
- Work with experienced real estate attorney
- Use land trust structure
- Keep payments current (never late)
- Build reserves for balloon/refinance
- Document seller's informed consent
- Get title insurance

---

#### C. Lease Options

**How It Works:**
You lease a property with the option (not obligation) to purchase at a predetermined price within a set timeframe.

**Lease Option Structure:**

| Component | Typical Terms |
|-----------|---------------|
| Option Fee | 1-5% of purchase price (credited if exercised) |
| Monthly Rent | At or slightly above market |
| Rent Credit | $100-300/month toward purchase (optional) |
| Purchase Price | Fixed or formula-based |
| Option Term | 1-3 years |
| Maintenance | Often tenant responsible |

```

**When to Use Lease Options:**

- Limited cash available
- Credit needs time to improve
- Want to "test" a market or property
- Seller won't do full seller financing
- Need time to arrange permanent financing

## Toby's ASCEND Financing Case Studies

### Case Study 1: The Private Money Start

**Situation:** New investor, good W2 income, limited cash, found great deal.

**The Deal:**
- Purchase: $110,000
- Rehab: $35,000
- ARV: $185,000
- Available cash: $25,000 (not enough for hard money down + rehab)

**Toby's Guidance:**
"You need $15k more than you have. Options: (1) Find a private lender for the gap, (2) Partner with someone for 50/50 split, (3) Assign the contract and make assignment fee. Don't stretch yourself too thin on your first deal."

**Solution Executed:**
- Student found private lender through REI meetup
- Private lender provided $40,000 at 10% interest
- Hard money covered purchase at 90% LTC
- Student brought $15,000 to closing
- Deal completed in 5 months, $38,000 profit
- Private lender earned $2,000, happy to lend again

**Lesson:** Relationships unlock capital. One successful deal creates future opportunities.

---

### Case Study 2: The Subject-To Rescue

**Situation:** Seller 3 months behind on $165,000 mortgage, facing foreclosure, house worth $200,000.

**The Numbers:**
```
Property Value: $200,000
Mortgage Balance: $165,000
Back Payments: $5,400
Seller's Equity: ~$35,000 (minus costs)
Seller's Mortgage Rate: 3.25% (2020 loan)
Current Market Rate: 7.5%
```

**Toby's Guidance:**
"This is a classic subject-to situation. Seller can't sell conventional because they can't bring money to closing after commissions. They're about to lose everything to foreclosure. You can save their credit and capture that 3.25% rate. Offer to bring mortgage current, give seller small amount for equity, take over payments."

**Deal Structure:**
```
Bring mortgage current: $5,400
Pay seller for equity: $3,000
Closing costs: $2,000
Total investment: $10,400

Monthly payment: $718 (at 3.25%)
Monthly rental value: $1,500
Monthly cash flow: $782

If refinanced at 7.5%:
Payment would be: $1,188
Cash flow would be: $312
Monthly savings: $470
```

**Lesson:** Subject-to can be win-win. Seller avoids foreclosure, investor gets below-market financing.

---

### Case Study 3: The BRRRR Refinance Challenge

**Situation:** Investor completed flip but decided to hold as rental. Needed to refinance out of hard money.

**The Numbers:**
```
Purchase: $85,000
Rehab: $40,000
Total Investment: $125,000
Hard Money Loan: $112,500
New Appraised Value: $175,000
```

**Toby's Guidance:**
"Your goal is to refinance at 75% LTV, pull out your capital, and hold long-term. At $175k appraisal, 75% = $131,250 cash-out refi. That covers your hard money payoff plus some, but you're still leaving $5-6k in the deal after closing costs. To truly pull all your capital out, you either need the property to appraise higher, or accept leaving a small amount in."

**Refinance Structure:**
```
New Loan (75% LTV): $131,250
Pay off hard money: -$112,500
Closing costs: -$4,500
Cash back: $14,250

Cash invested: $12,500 (down payment) + $40,000 (rehab) = $52,500
Cash returned: $14,250
Cash left in deal: $38,250

Monthly rent: $1,400
Monthly PITI: $1,050
Monthly cash flow: $350
Cash-on-cash return: 11% ($4,200 annual / $38,250 invested)
```

**Lesson:** BRRRR doesn't always mean "no money left in deal." Running the numbers accurately sets proper expectations.

## Recommended Exercises

### Exercise 1: Build Your Financing Comparison Spreadsheet

**Purpose:** Understand true costs of each financing option

**Method:**
1. Create spreadsheet with columns for each financing type
2. Input current rates from 3 lenders in each category
3. Calculate total cost for a sample $150,000, 12-month loan
4. Compare: Which is cheapest? Which is fastest? Which fits which deal?
5. Update quarterly as rates change

**Time Required:** 2-3 hours initial; 30 min quarterly updates

---

### Exercise 2: The Private Lender Prospecting Plan

**Purpose:** Build your private money network before you need it

**Method:**
1. List 20 people you know who might have $50k+ in savings
2. Research: Do they seem frustrated with stock market or low bank rates?
3. Craft your 30-second private lending elevator pitch
4. Practice the pitch until natural
5. Have 3 conversations this week (educational, not sales)
6. Track responses and follow up

**Time Required:** 4-6 hours initial prospecting
**Goal:** 2-3 potential private lenders identified within 90 days

---

### Exercise 3: The Seller Financing Roleplay

**Purpose:** Practice negotiating seller financing terms

**Method:**
1. Find a partner (fellow investor or spouse)
2. One plays investor, one plays seller with these scenarios:
   - Seller owns free and clear, wants cash but flexible
   - Seller has mortgage, behind on payments
   - Seller is estate executor, heirs want income stream
3. Practice your seller financing pitch
4. Negotiate terms (down payment, rate, term, balloon)
5. Switch roles and repeat
6. Debrief: What worked? What felt awkward?

**Time Required:** 1-2 hours
**Skill Built:** Confidence in creative financing conversations

---

### Exercise 4: Analyze a Subject-To Scenario

**Purpose:** Understand when subject-to makes sense and when it doesn't

**Method:**
1. Find a listing that's been on market 90+ days with price reductions
2. Estimate: What might the seller's mortgage balance be?
3. Calculate: If you took over their loan subject-to, what would cash flow be?
4. Calculate: What's the rate arbitrage savings?
5. Identify: What risks exist? How would you mitigate?
6. Decide: Would you pursue this as a subject-to? Why or why not?

**Time Required:** 2-3 hours per analysis
**Repeat:** Until subject-to analysis feels natural

---

### Exercise 5: Create Your Financing Preferences Document

**Purpose:** Clarify your financing strategy before you need to decide

**Method:**
Document your answers to these questions:
1. What's my maximum acceptable interest rate for a flip?
2. What's my maximum acceptable rate for a rental?
3. How much capital can I personally invest?
4. What's my timeline for deals (need fast closing or can wait)?
5. What credit score do I have? What DTI?
6. Who do I know who might lend privately?
7. What's my risk tolerance for creative structures?

**Time Required:** 1 hour
**Update:** Annually or after major financial changes

## Key Takeaways

1. **Match Financing to Strategy:** Flips need speed (hard/private); holds need low cost (conventional)
2. **Build Relationships Before Deals:** Private lender network takes time; start now
3. **Understand True Costs:** Points, fees, and time all factor into real cost of capital
4. **Creative Financing Requires Skill:** Subject-to and seller financing work but need proper structuring
5. **Never Over-Leverage:** Bad financing can kill good deals; good financing can't save bad deals
6. **Multiple Options = Power:** Having 3-4 financing sources gives negotiating leverage
7. **Document Everything:** Especially with creative structures—protect all parties
8. **Credit Matters (Usually):** Maintain good credit even if using non-traditional financing
9. **Relationships Beat Rates:** A reliable lender at 12% beats an unreliable one at 10%
10. **Exit Strategy Informs Financing:** Know how you'll pay off before you borrow
