### Why Did Toby Coach Students to Avoid Certain Markets?

**Market Selection is the First Deal Decision**

The best analysis skills in the world can't save you in the wrong market. Toby's coaching emphasizes market selection BEFORE deal sourcing because:

1. **Market velocity determines exit certainty**
   - Fast-moving markets = quick sales, predictable timelines
   - Slow markets = holding cost risk, price discovery issues

2. **Price point affects buyer pool**
   - <$150k markets have cash buyer competition (wholesalers, investors)
   - $200-400k markets have retail buyer depth
   - >$500k markets have fewer buyers, longer selling times

3. **Economic fundamentals drive sustainability**
   - Single-employer towns are risky (plant closure = market crash)
   - Diversified economies absorb shocks better
   - Population growth markets outperform declining areas

### The "Sherman-Denison Problem" — Toby's Texas Market Case Study

**What Happened:**
Sherman-Denison, Texas appeared attractive to investors:
- Low entry prices ($80-120k properties)
- Decent rent-to-value ratios
- Northern DFW spillover expected

**The Hidden Problem:**
- Limited economic diversity (heavily dependent on few employers)
- Thin buyer pool (few retail buyers for flips)
- High investor competition (everyone saw same "opportunity")
- Slow appreciation despite DFW proximity
- Exit times stretched from 30 days to 90+ days

**Toby's Warning Signs:**
"When you see lots of investors but not many retail buyers, you're competing for the same exit. The market looks good on paper, but when you go to sell, you're selling to other investors—and they want deals too. You can't both get a deal."

**Lesson:** Analyze WHO is buying, not just WHAT is selling.

### What Market Signals Indicate "Too Hot" vs. "Opportunity"?

**"Too Hot" Market Signals (Danger Zone):**
- Days on market <10 for any decent property
- Multiple offers on every listing (5+ common)
- Investors waiving inspections to compete
- Appraisals consistently coming in below contract
- Rent-to-price ratios below 0.5% monthly
- "Guru" courses featuring the market
- National media coverage ("hottest market!")

**"Opportunity" Market Signals:**
- Days on market 20-45 (balanced)
- 2-4 offers on good properties (competitive but manageable)
- Deals still possible with proper due diligence
- Rent-to-price ratios 0.8-1.2% monthly
- Population growth 1-3% annually
- Job growth positive, diversified employers
- Infrastructure investments announced
- Not yet "discovered" by national investors

**"Distressed/Declining" Market Signals (Avoid):**
- Days on market >90 average
- Few buyers at any price point
- Population declining
- Major employer layoffs or closures
- Government/institutional selling (foreclosures spiking)
- Rents declining
- High vacancy rates

### How Do You Identify Emerging Markets Before They Peak?

**The Leading Indicator Framework:**

**Stage 1: Pre-Discovery (Best Time to Enter)**
- Population growth just starting (1-2%)
- New employers announcing
- Infrastructure projects funded
- Still affordable to median income
- Few investors aware
- Media coverage: None

**Stage 2: Early Discovery (Good Entry)**
- Population growth accelerating (2-3%)
- Job growth visible in data
- First "this market is interesting" articles
- Prices rising but still below neighboring markets
- Investor interest growing
- Media coverage: Trade publications

**Stage 3: Mainstream Discovery (Caution)**
- Population growth strong (3%+)
- Multiple national employers arrived
- "Hottest market" articles appearing
- Prices catching up to comparable markets
- Heavy investor activity
- Media coverage: National news

**Stage 4: Peak/Saturation (Danger)**
- Population growth may slow (migration slowing)
- All the good deals require top-dollar
- "This time is different" mentality
- Prices exceed fundamentals
- Investors competing fiercely
- Media coverage: HGTV shows, guru courses

**Stage 5: Correction (Wait for Opportunity)**
- Prices declining or flat
- Investors fleeing
- "Market is dead" narrative
- Deals emerge as holders capitulate
- Cash buyers win
- Media coverage: "Market crash" stories

## Executive Summary

Market analysis and deal sourcing are the twin skills that feed every successful real estate business. Understanding where to invest (market selection) and how to find deals (sourcing) creates sustainable competitive advantage. This research provides comprehensive frameworks for analyzing markets, sourcing deals through multiple channels, and building relationships that generate consistent deal flow.

The core principle: **The best investors find the best markets AND the best deals within those markets.**

### 2. Neighborhood Valuation Methodology

#### Price-Per-Square-Foot Trend Analysis

**Why $/Sq Ft Matters:**
- Normalizes comparisons across different sized properties
- Shows true market direction (up, down, flat)
- Identifies neighborhoods outperforming or underperforming
- Reveals where to buy (below trend) and where to avoid (above trend)

**How to Calculate $/Sq Ft Trends:**

```
Step 1: Pull sold data for target neighborhood (90-180 days)
Step 2: Calculate $/sq ft for each sale
Step 3: Calculate average $/sq ft
Step 4: Compare to:
   - Same neighborhood 1 year ago
   - Same neighborhood 2 years ago
   - Adjacent/competing neighborhoods now
   - Market overall average

EXAMPLE:
Neighborhood: Oak Hills, Dallas suburb

Current average $/sq ft: $145
1 year ago: $138
2 years ago: $125

Year-over-year change: +5.1%
Two-year change: +16%
Market overall: +4% YoY

Analysis: Oak Hills appreciating faster than market average.
Consider: Is this sustainable? What's driving it?

### 3. Deal Sourcing Strategies

#### Source 1: MLS (Multiple Listing Service)

**Pros:**
- Largest inventory of available properties
- Clear pricing data
- Professional representation
- Structured transaction process

**Cons:**
- Most competitive channel
- Full retail or near-retail pricing
- Slower deal flow
- Agent commissions add cost

**MLS Deal Finding Strategies:**

1. **Days on Market Filter**
   - Target: 45+ DOM listings
   - Why: Motivated sellers, price reduction likely
   - Action: Make below-asking offers, be patient

2. **Price Reduction Alerts**
   - Target: Properties with 2+ reductions
   - Why: Seller motivation increasing
   - Action: Track reduction pattern, time your offer

3. **Failed Pending Alert**
   - Target: Properties back on market after pending
   - Why: Seller frustrated, deal may have fallen through for fixable reason
   - Action: Ask listing agent what happened, make clean offer

4. **REO/Bank-Owned**
   - Target: Foreclosure properties on MLS
   - Why: Banks want to move inventory
   - Action: Submit through asset manager, be patient with process

5. **Estate Sales**
   - Target: Listings mentioning estate, probate, inherited
   - Why: Heirs often want quick sale, may price below market
   - Action: Move quickly, offer simplicity

---

#### Source 2: Wholesalers

**Pros:**
- Pre-negotiated deals
- Often off-market opportunities
- Wholesale pricing (below market)
- Deal flow without marketing cost

**Cons:**
- Wholesale fee adds cost
- Quality varies significantly
- ARVs often inflated
- Repair estimates often low

**Building Wholesaler Relationships:**

1. **Find Active Wholesalers:**
   - Attend local REI meetups
   - Join Facebook investor groups
   - Search "we buy houses" + [your city]
   - Ask other investors who they use

2. **Evaluate Wholesaler Quality:**
   - How long in business?
   - How many deals closed monthly?
   - References from other buyers?
   - How do they calculate ARV and repairs?

3. **Set Clear Criteria:**
   - Provide written buying criteria
   - Be specific: Price range, neighborhoods, property types
   - Communicate response timeline expectations

4. **Build Preference Status:**
   - Close deals you commit to
   - Respond quickly to opportunities
   - Give honest feedback on rejected deals
   - Pay on time, every time

**Wholesaler Deal Evaluation Checklist:**

```
□ Verify wholesaler's ARV with your own comp analysis
□ Verify repair estimate with your contractor or walkthrough
□ Confirm assignment fee is reasonable (<$10k typical)
□ Check title for liens and issues before signing
□ Confirm inspection period adequate for due diligence
□ Calculate your numbers independently (never trust provided)
□ Verify property access for inspection
□ Confirm seller awareness of assignment
□ Check EMD amount and disposition
□ Review contract for investor-friendly terms
```

#### Source 4: Foreclosures and Auctions

**Pros:**
- Below-market pricing possible
- Motivated seller (bank)
- Clear process

| **Auction** | Public sale on courthouse steps | Bid and win, cash required |
| **REO** | Bank took possession | Purchase from bank, often on MLS |

**Auction Bidding Rules:**

1. Research properties BEFORE auction day
2. Set maximum bid based on analysis (don't exceed)
3. Bring required funds (cashier's check typically)
4. Inspect exterior (interior often not accessible)
5. Title search completed pre-auction
6. Have exit strategy before bidding
7. Know redemption rights in your state
8. Factor in back taxes, liens, potential occupancy issues

#### Source 5: Driving for Dollars

**Pros:**
- Truly off-market opportunities
- Local market knowledge building
- Low cost (time investment)
- No competition initially

**Cons:**
- Time intensive
- Skip tracing costs
- Low response rates
- Requires follow-up systems

**Driving for Dollars Process:**

```
Step 1: IDENTIFY TARGET AREAS

## Toby's ASCEND Market Case Studies

### Case Study 1: The Texas Secondary Market Analysis

**Situation:** Student wanted to invest outside expensive Austin/Dallas core markets.

**Markets Considered:**
- San Antonio (large, established)
- Killeen/Temple (military base dependent)
- Waco (emerging, Magnolia effect)
- Sherman-Denison (spillover from DFW)
- Tyler/Longview (East Texas, oil dependent)

**Toby's Analysis Framework:**

```
SAN ANTONIO:
+ Large, diversified economy
+ Strong military presence (recession resistant)
+ Growing tech sector
+ Multiple exit strategies viable
+ Good contractor availability
- Increasing competition from California investors
- Prices rising faster than rents
SCORE: 78/100 - GOOD

KILLEEN/TEMPLE:
+ Very affordable entry prices
+ Strong rental demand (military)
+ Good cash flow potential
- Single employer dependency (Fort Hood/Cavazos)
- Base realignment risk
- Limited retail buyer pool
SCORE: 62/100 - FAIR (proceed cautiously)

WACO:
+ Strong appreciation post-Magnolia
+ Growing population
+ Affordable relative to larger markets
- "Magnolia premium" may be priced in
- Limited economic diversity
- Small market overall
SCORE: 65/100 - FAIR

SHERMAN-DENISON:
+ Very affordable
+ DFW spillover potential
+ Decent rent ratios
- Thin buyer pool for exits
- Heavy investor competition
- Limited economic drivers
SCORE: 52/100 - WEAK (avoid for flips)

TYLER/LONGVIEW:
+ Affordable entry
+ Decent cash flow
- Oil industry dependency
- Population stagnant
- Limited growth catalysts
SCORE: 48/100 - WEAK (avoid)
```

**Toby's Recommendation:**
"San Antonio is your safest bet for balanced flip/rental strategy. Killeen works for buy-and-hold if you understand military market dynamics. Avoid Sherman-Denison for flips—you'll compete with too many investors for limited exits. Tyler/Longview only if you have specific local knowledge and very conservative underwriting."

### Case Study 2: The Deal Sourcing Diversification

**Situation:** Student relying 100% on wholesalers for deal flow. Getting mediocre deals, paying high assignment fees.

**Toby's Assessment:**
"You're competing with every other wholesaler buyer in town for the same deals. The wholesaler does the marketing, finds the motivated seller, negotiates—then marks it up. You're buying their inventory, not creating your own. Time to diversify."

**Recommended Deal Source Portfolio:**

```
CURRENT STATE:
Wholesalers: 100%
MLS: 0%
Direct to seller: 0%
Network referrals: 0%

TARGET STATE (6 months):
Wholesalers: 40% (still use, but selective)
MLS: 25% (build agent relationships)
Direct mail: 20% (create own deal flow)
Driving/D2S: 10% (supplement)
Network: 5% (relationships)

IMPLEMENTATION:
Month 1-2: Add 2 investor-friendly agents, set criteria
Month 2-3: Launch 500-piece direct mail test campaign
Month 3-4: Start driving for dollars 3 hours/week
Month 4-5: Attend 2 REI events, build network
Month 6: Evaluate, adjust percentages
```

**Outcome (6 months later):**
- Student closed 3 deals from agents (better margins than wholesaler deals)
- Direct mail generating 3-5 leads monthly
- One deal from driving for dollars (best margin yet)
- Assignment fee savings: Average $4k/deal (no middleman)
- Overall profitability up 35%

---

### Case Study 3: The "Too Hot" Market Exit

**Situation:** Student had been successful in Austin market 2019-2021. By late 2022, finding deals became nearly impossible.

**Market Indicators:**
- DOM: <7 days for anything decent
- Multiple offers: 10-15 offers common
- Investors waiving inspections to compete
- Prices exceeding sustainable levels
- Appraisals regularly below contract

**Toby's Guidance:**
"Austin isn't a deal market anymore—it's a speculation market. You're not finding deals, you're hoping appreciation bails you out. That's gambling. Two options: (1) Expand to San Antonio or secondary markets, (2) Shift strategy to off-market only with creative financing."

**Student's Pivot:**
- Shifted 70% of focus to San Antonio market
- Kept Austin presence but only for off-market/creative deals
- Developed direct-to-seller marketing in SA
- Accepted lower appreciation potential for better margins

**Lesson:** Markets cycle. Adapt strategy to market conditions; don't force it.
