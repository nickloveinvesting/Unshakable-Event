## Tough Love Callouts

### Callout 1 (Part 1)

**Quote:** "Every time you say 'it's just faster if I do it myself,' you're building your own prison."
**Purpose:** Overcome the documentation avoidance trap

**Quote:** "You want to know why your company culture sucks? Because you tolerate behavior that contradicts your values."
**Purpose:** Confront passive culture management

## Language Consistency

### Terms Used Consistently
- "Unshakable Empire" (not "business" or "company" when referring to the vision)
- "Self-employed" vs. "Business owner" (clear distinction maintained)
- "Speed is currency" (exact phrase, not variations)
- "Non-negotiables" (not "core values" or "principles")
- "S-quadrant" and "B-quadrant" (consistent with Section 3)

### Terms Avoided
- "Hustle" (overused, doesn't match Toby's tone)
- "Grind" (implies unsustainability)
- "Boss babe/girl boss" (dated, gendered)
- "Passive income" (misleading—Section 3 addresses this)
