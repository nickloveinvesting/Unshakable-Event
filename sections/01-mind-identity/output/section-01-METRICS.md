# Section 1: Draft Metrics
## The Unshakable Empire Workbook - Mind & Identity

---

## Word Count Analysis

| Metric | Count | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Total Words** | 6,739 | 8,000-12,000 | Slightly Under Target |
| **Estimated Pages (printed)** | ~22 pages | 25-35 pages | Slightly Under Target |

**Note:** Word count is slightly below target. This is intentional for the first draft—Tier 3 Voice Integration will add:
- Additional Toby voice callouts
- Expanded personal stories
- More directive language and transitions
- Additional "tough love" sections

Expected final word count after Tier 3: 8,500-9,500 words.

## Structure Breakdown

| Section | Estimated Words | % of Total |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Section Overview | ~450 | 7% |
| Introduction: The Identity Crisis | ~700 | 10% |
| Part 1: Neuroscience of Identity | ~850 | 13% |
| Part 2: Cognitive Frameworks (CBT) | ~1,100 | 16% |
| Part 3: Psychological Archetypes | ~900 | 13% |
| Part 4: Narrative Identity | ~750 | 11% |
| Part 5: "I Am Becoming..." Framework | ~900 | 13% |
| Part 6: Self-Assessment & Clarity | ~600 | 9% |
| Summary & Transition | ~500 | 8% |

**Balance Assessment:** Good distribution across parts. No single section dominates. Parts 2 (CBT) and Part 5 ("I Am Becoming") receive appropriate emphasis as most actionable content.
