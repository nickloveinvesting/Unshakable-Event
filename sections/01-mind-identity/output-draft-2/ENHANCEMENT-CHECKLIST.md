## Section-Specific Enhancement Notes:

### Stories Present:
1. Farm/childhood story ("poor farm kid")
2. 2008 teaser story (losing Imperial Mortgage)
3. Borrowed identity origin story
4. Creator-Ruler archetype personal example
5. Identity Declaration example

### Stories Needed:
- Additional crisis references connecting to Section 9
- IGNITE program mention/connection
- More "speed is currency" moments

### Gaps Identified:
1. **IGNITE connections**: Zero mentions of Transformation Academy, IGNITE, or ASCEND
2. **"Real Talk" callouts**: All callouts use "Toby's Tough Love" format - need to either convert or add "Real Talk" specifically
3. **Crisis depth**: Only 1-2 light references to 2008; could strengthen forward reference to Section 9

### Exercises Review:
- Exercise 1.1: Thought Record & Belief Audit ✓
- Exercise 1.2: Archetype Assessment ✓
- Exercise 1.3: Life Timeline & Story Reframe ✓
- Exercise 1.4: Identity Declaration ✓
- Exercise 1.5: Pain vs. Vision Ledger ✓

## Priority Actions for Draft 2:

1. Add 3+ IGNITE/Transformation Academy references
2. Add or convert to 3+ "Real Talk" callouts
3. Strengthen crisis references (forward to Section 9)
4. Integrate competitive research quotes/principles
5. Add implementation timers to exercises
