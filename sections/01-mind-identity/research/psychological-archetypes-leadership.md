## Core Frameworks

### 1. Jung's Foundational Archetype Theory

**Definition:** Archetypes are universal, inherited patterns of thought, image, and behavior that reside in the collective unconscious—the inherited, ancestral layer of the human psyche.

**Key Jungian Archetypes:**

| Archetype | Description | Function |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **The Self** | The unified, whole personality | Integration and individuation |
| **The Persona** | The social mask we wear | Navigation of social expectations |
| **The Shadow** | Repressed, denied aspects of self | Contains both darkness and gold |
| **The Anima/Animus** | Contrasexual inner figure | Balance and wholeness |

**Jung's Core Insight:** "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."

### 2. The Pearson 12-Archetype System

Carol Pearson identified twelve archetypes because each contributes to individual and group success. Based on Jung and Campbell:

**The Four Quarters of Development:**

### 4. The Shadow Self in Leadership

**Jung's Definition:** The shadow is an unconscious aspect of the personality that does not correspond with the ego ideal, leading the ego to resist and project it.

**Critical Insight:** "Far from being purely negative, the Shadow contains not only our darker impulses but also positive qualities that were suppressed."

**Shadow Contains:**
- **The Dark Shadow:** Traits we consider unacceptable (anger, selfishness, weakness)
- **The Golden Shadow:** Positive qualities we suppressed (confidence, creativity, power)

**Leadership Shadow Work:**

| Archetype | Light Expression | Shadow Expression |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Ruler | Responsible leader | The Tyrant—oppressive, power-hungry |
| Warrior | Courageous achiever | Ruthless destroyer |
| Caregiver | Generous helper | Martyred manipulator |
| Magician | Wise transformer | Manipulative schemer |

**Why Shadow Work Matters for Leaders:**
- Unexamined shadow gets projected onto team members
- Shadow drives unconscious acting out of power dynamics
- Understanding projection transforms interpersonal conflicts into self-knowledge opportunities
- Integration reduces anxiety, depression, and relationship difficulties

**The Four Archetypal Energies for Leadership:**

1. **King/Queen (Ruler):** Leadership, authority, wisdom, creating order and meaning
2. **Warrior:** Courage, strength, confronting challenges, protecting what matters
