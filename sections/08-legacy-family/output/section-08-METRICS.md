- Special needs planning (mentioned generically)

---

## Revision Notes for Tier 3 Voice Integration

### Additions Recommended:
1. More Taylor/Amber dialogue (add 2-3 specific conversations)
2. More specific Toby failures/mistakes (shows vulnerability)
3. Plain English glossary for estate planning terms
4. More examples of family mission statements
5. More specific teaching curriculum examples per age

### Potential Cuts (If Space Needed):
1. Estate planning trust types (could be appendix)
2. Tax minimization strategies (could be simplified)
3. Detailed law citations (could be removed)
4. Some framework boxes (could be combined)

**Recommendation:** Add dialogue/examples rather than cutting. This is the longest section for good reason.
