## Recommendations for Revision

### Areas for Potential Enhancement

1. **Add 3-4 more forward references** to meet 10+ target
   - Section 4 (Sales): Could reference sales discipline
   - Section 8 (Legacy): Could reference family discipline modeling

2. **Consider adding faith thread** - Currently light; could add Faith Foundation callout box

3. **Exercise 2.3 could include** more specific recovery protocol for missed days

4. **Transition page** could be expanded with more specific Section 3 preview

### Strengths to Maintain

1. Strong opening story (farm narrative)
2. Clear progression from science to application
3. Directive tone consistent throughout
4. Good balance of teaching and doing
5. Effective Toby voice in callouts
