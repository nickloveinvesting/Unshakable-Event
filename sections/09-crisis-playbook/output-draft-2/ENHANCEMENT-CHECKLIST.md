   - May be intentional for capstone section
   - Consider whether trimming is appropriate

## Priority Actions for Draft 2:

1. Add or convert to 3+ "Real Talk" callouts
2. Evaluate word count - may be intentionally longer for capstone
3. Integrate competitive research quotes/principles
4. Add implementation timers to exercises
5. Review for passive voice elimination
6. Ensure consistent callout formatting

### Note on Word Count:
As the capstone section telling the full 2008 story and integrating all previous sections, the longer word count may be intentional. Consider whether to:
- Trim to match 12,000 word target
- Accept longer length for narrative completeness
- Create supplementary material for overflow
