# Exercise Progression Framework
## The Unshakable Empire Workbook - Skill Building Architecture

This document maps how exercises progress from foundational to advanced, ensuring skills build systematically and later exercises reference/require earlier competencies.

---

## Exercise Progression Philosophy

```
FOUNDATION          →    APPLICATION         →    INTEGRATION        →    MASTERY
(Know/Understand)        (Do/Practice)            (Connect/Synthesize)    (Teach/Lead)
Sections 1-2             Sections 3-5             Sections 6-8            Section 9
```

**Principle:** Each exercise should either:
1. Build a foundational skill for later exercises
2. Apply a foundational skill in a new context
3. Integrate multiple skills from earlier sections
4. Test all skills under pressure (crisis simulation)

```
□ Exercise 1.1 ──→ □ Exercise 1.2 ──→ □ Exercise 1.3 ...
      │                   │                   │
      └───────────────────┴───────────────────┘
                          │
                    SECTION 1 COMPLETE
                          │
                          ↓
             □ Exercise 2.1 ──→ ...
```

Each exercise checkbox should include:
- Completion date
- Key insight captured
- Next action identified

---

*This exercise progression ensures learners build skills systematically, with each exercise preparing for the next and the final Section 9 exercises testing mastery of the complete system.*
