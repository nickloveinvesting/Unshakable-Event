## Themes Throughout The Workbook

### 1. Speed is Currency
Velocity > Perfection. Move faster than comfortable, iterate, improve.

### 2. Systems are Freedom
Documented processes and clear authority create the freedom to scale beyond yourself.

### 3. Vision is Multiplication
Your purpose must be bigger than you to attract team members and sustain through difficulty.

### 4. Cashflow is Oxygen
Positive cashflow sustains; negative cashflow suffocates. Non-negotiable principle.

### 5. Identity Determines Behavior
Who you believe you are determines what you'll build, how you'll sell, and what you'll achieve.
