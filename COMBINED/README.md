## Key Themes

### Speed is Currency
Throughout all sections, the recurring principle: velocity > perfection. Move faster than comfortable, iterate, improve.

### Systems are Freedom
Documented processes, clear authority, meeting rhythms—these create the freedom to scale beyond yourself.

### Vision is Multiplication
Your purpose must be bigger than you to attract team members and sustain through difficulty.

### Cashflow is Oxygen
Every financial decision tests this principle: positive cashflow sustains; negative cashflow suffocates.

### Identity Determines Behavior
Who you believe you are determines what you'll build, how you'll sell, and what you'll achieve.
