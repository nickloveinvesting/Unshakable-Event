## BUSINESS FOCUS OVERVIEW

This batch is for entrepreneurs and business builders who want to understand the complete journey from personal identity to scalable systems.

If your primary focus is building a profitable, sustainable business that scales beyond your personal effort, this is your path.

### What This Batch Covers

**Section 1: Mind & Identity**
- YOUR IDENTITY AS A BUILDER
- How your self-concept determines what you'll build
- Archetypal leadership styles and what they mean for business
- The "I am becoming a business owner" declaration

**Section 4: Sales**
- HOW YOU SELL YOUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND VISION
- The psychology of influence in business conversations
- Your natural sales style and how to leverage it
- Handling objections and closing deals
- Building a predictable sales pipeline

**Section 5: Business Building**
- HOW YOU SCALE FROM SOLO TO SYSTEMS-DRIVEN MACHINE
- The Business Model Canvas and value proposition
- Documentation and SOPs that create freedom
- Building teams and creating culture
- The scaling frameworks that work

### Why These Three Together?

The business building journey has three phases:

**Identity First** — You must believe you're a business owner (not just self-employed) before you can build one.

**Sales Second** — Revenue is the lifeblood. You must be able to generate it consistently and ethically.

**Systems Third** — Revenue without systems is burnout. Systems convert revenue into scalable profit.
