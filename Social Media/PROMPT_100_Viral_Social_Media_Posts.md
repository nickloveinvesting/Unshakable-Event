## RESEARCH FOUNDATION

This prompt is informed by comprehensive social media research including:
- **5 Major Influencer Analysis:** Alex Hormozi (3.47M YouTube), Andy Elliott (2M Instagram), Tony Robbins (8M Instagram), Brendon Burchard, Russell Brunson
- **80+ web searches** across YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, and LIVE video strategies

### Key Research Findings to Apply:

**From Alex Hormozi:**
- $90K/month content investment, 250-300 pieces/week
- "Create once, repurpose forever" - 1 video = 30+ derivatives
- Strategic pivot to specific audience ($3M-$30M business owners)
- Lead with failures, not flexing success
- Tested 3,000 ads to find 7 that worked

**From Andy Elliott:**
- 220+ pieces/month, 98.6% YouTube like rate
- Confrontational "tough love" messaging works
- Short-form dominance (Reels, Shorts, TikTok)
- Raw, authentic content outperforms polished

**From Tony Robbins:**
- 85-10-5 Rule: 85% value, 10% community, 5% promotional
- Behind-the-scenes content outperforms polished
- AI chatbot integration ("DM 'AI' - ask Tony anything")

**From Team Meeting (Nov 25, 2025) - Key Strategic Quotes:**

> "Two biggest drivers of growth on social media are posting content with **entertainment and emotion**. Both of those things... Entertainment and emotion gets new people and education keeps them." - Wesley

> "We had almost 27,000 views on that [live video] inside a week... But those are also those dramas of the landlord having shitty tenants. People loved it... We had 60-130K views on that drama content." - Toby

> "Raw, honest content wins... Show vulnerabilities, not just wins." - Team consensus

> "We want 500 people on that [Monday IGNITE] call... That's got to be our goal in the next 45 days." - Toby

> "We don't have enough presence to charge what we know the value of the product is." - Toby

> "Those 580 people [who clicked the ad] need to be getting hit every day." - Toby

> "LinkedIn has a crazy amount of virality potential and your... our target audience is probably on there." - Wesley

## ABOUT IGNITE PROGRAM

**What It Is:** A 28-day tactical, faith-centered transformation protocol designed to rebuild lives from the inside out.

**Core Philosophy:** "This is a partnership. This is a relationship. This is about us understanding, evolving, growing, and building with each other unlike any other course out there."

**The Problem It Solves:** Combats "drift" - mindless scrolling, reactive decision-making, lack of direction, feeling stuck despite having potential.

**Three Pillars:**
1. **Mental Mastery** - Reclaim inner control, eliminate self-sabotage
2. **Spiritual Authority** - Faith-centered grounding and purpose
3. **Physical Stewardship** - Disciplined body, disciplined life

**4-Week Structure:**
- Week 1: Establishing Command (reclaim control)
- Week 2: Forging Vision (crystal-clear future self)
- Week 3: Self-Audit (brutal honesty and accountability)
- Week 4: Solidifying Protocol (integrate daily disciplines)

**Pricing:**
- Regular: $99/month
- December Special: $19.95/month (lifetime locked rate for December signups)

**Goal:** 500 members on Monday morning IGNITE calls within 45 days

**Target Audience:**
- Entrepreneurs and business builders (ages 30-55)
- Real estate investors
- People feeling stuck despite having potential
- Those wanting proven SYSTEMS, not just motivation

## VIRAL CONTENT PRINCIPLES (Apply to Every Post)

Based on research analysis:

### The 3 E's Priority Order:
1. **Entertainment** - Makes people stop scrolling, want to share
2. **Emotion** - Creates connection, relatability, reaction
3. **Education** - Keeps people coming back, builds authority

### What Goes Viral:
| Element | Why It Works | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Hook in first 3 seconds | Stops the scroll | "Stop lying to yourself..." |
| Polarizing opinions | Generates debate/comments | "Goal setting is overrated" |
| Specific numbers | Creates credibility | "$600 to $10M", "28 days", "5:30 AM" |
| Raw beats polished | Authenticity builds trust | Office setting, not studio |
| Story-based vulnerability | Connection > perfection | "I lost everything at 42..." |
| Pattern interrupts | Unexpected angles | Challenge common advice |
| Confrontational openings | Direct accusation hooks | "You're not stuck. You're comfortable." |

### Proven Hook Formats (Use These):
- "You're not [X]. You're [unexpected truth]."
- "The reason you're still [problem] isn't what you think..."
- "I lost everything and here's what nobody tells you..."
- "Stop [common advice]. Here's what actually works..."
- "The [number] second decision that changed my life..."
- "Nobody talks about the [dark side/real truth] of [topic]..."
- "Let me tell you how your [X] sounds to everyone else..."
- "[Number] days. [Number] phases. Here's the exact framework..."

### Content Structure for Each Post:
**Hook** (3 seconds) → **Agitation** (create tension) → **Story/Example** (make it real) → **Solution/Insight** (the payoff) → **Soft CTA** (invite action)
