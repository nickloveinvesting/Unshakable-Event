## CONTENT PRINCIPLES FROM RESEARCH

After reading the research files, apply these proven patterns:

### The 3 E's (Priority Order):
1. **Entertainment** - Stop the scroll, make them want to share
2. **Emotion** - Create connection, relatability, reaction
3. **Education** - Build authority, provide value

### What Performs Best:
- Raw/authentic beats polished
- Specific numbers create credibility ("$600 to $10M", "28 days", "5:30 AM")
- Polarizing opinions generate engagement
- Story-based vulnerability builds trust
- Pattern interrupts grab attention

### Platform-Specific Insights:
- **LinkedIn:** Carousels perform extremely well, text-first often beats video, professional vulnerability works, high-value B2B audience
- **Instagram:** Test content here first, Reels under 30 seconds, save-worthy carousels
- **TikTok:** First 1-2 seconds critical, trending formats, entertainment over education
