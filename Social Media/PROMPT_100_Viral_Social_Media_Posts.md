## ABOUT IGNITE PROGRAM

**What It Is:** A 28-day tactical, faith-centered transformation protocol designed to rebuild lives from the inside out.

**Core Philosophy:** "This is a partnership. This is a relationship. This is about us understanding, evolving, growing, and building with each other unlike any other course out there."

**The Problem It Solves:** Combats "drift" – mindless scrolling, reactive decision-making, lack of direction, feeling stuck despite having potential.

**Three Pillars:**
1. **Mental Mastery** – Reclaim inner control, eliminate self-sabotage
2. **Spiritual Authority** – Faith-centered grounding and purpose
3. **Physical Stewardship** – Disciplined body, disciplined life

**4-Week Structure:**
- Week 1: Establishing Command (reclaim control)
- Week 2: Forging Vision (crystal-clear future self)
- Week 3: Self-Audit (brutal honesty and accountability)
- Week 4: Solidifying Protocol (integrate daily disciplines)

**Pricing:** $19.95/month (December special, lifetime locked rate)

**Target Audience:**
- Entrepreneurs and business builders (ages 30-55)
- Real estate investors
- People feeling stuck despite having potential
- Those wanting proven SYSTEMS, not motivation
- Faith-aligned individuals seeking practical transformation

## VIRAL CONTENT RESEARCH INSIGHTS

Based on analysis of Alex Hormozi (3.47M YouTube subs), Andy Elliott (2M Instagram), Tony Robbins (8M Instagram), Brendon Burchard, and Russell Brunson:

**What Goes Viral:**
1. **Hook in first 3 seconds** – Direct accusation/challenge that stops the scroll
2. **Polarizing opinions** – Generate engagement through debate
3. **Specific numbers and timeframes** – Credibility through specificity
4. **Raw beats polished** – Authentic > professional production
5. **Entertainment + Emotion FIRST, education second** – People scroll for feelings
6. **Story-based vulnerability** – Share struggles, not just wins
7. **Pattern interrupts** – Unexpected angles on common topics

**Proven Hook Formats:**
- "You're not [X]. You're [unexpected truth]."
- "The reason you're still [problem] isn't what you think..."
- "I lost everything and here's what nobody tells you..."
- "Stop [common advice]. Here's what actually works..."
- "The [number] second decision that changed my life..."
- "Nobody talks about the [dark side/real truth] of [topic]..."

**Content Structure:**
Hook → Agitation → Story/Example → Solution/Insight → Soft CTA

## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Vary the intensity** – Not every post should be confrontational. Mix wake-up calls with encouragement.

2. **Include specific numbers** – "$600 to $10M", "28 days", "5:30 AM", "500 members" – specificity builds credibility.

3. **Reference real struggles** – Toby's story includes financial devastation, rebuilding, real estate success, family challenges.

4. **Create series potential** – Some posts should tease "Part 2" or be part of a themed week.

5. **Engagement hooks** – Include questions, polls, "comment if this is you" prompts.

6. **Controversy with purpose** – Polarizing takes should always lead back to transformation, not just shock value.

7. **Show the transformation** – Before/after, the journey, the protocol in action.
