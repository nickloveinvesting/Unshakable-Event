6. **Live Creates Premium Value:** Emphasizing live training, Q&A, and coaching creates perceived higher value than pre-recorded courses and justifies premium pricing.

7. **B2B + B2C Multiplier Effect:** Serving both individual salespeople and companies creates cross-pollination where social proof from each channel attracts the other.

8. **Repurposing Maximizes ROI:** Systematic repurposing of live content into Shorts, Reels, TikToks, podcast episodes, and academy materials maximizes return on single content creation effort.

9. **Authority Through Scale:** Quantified social proof (1.3M trained, 11,000 companies, 176 countries, $100M revenue) overcomes skepticism and accelerates trust at scale.

10. **Platform-Native Optimization:** Tailoring content specifically for each platform's format and culture (rather than cross-posting identical content) drives higher engagement across all channels.
