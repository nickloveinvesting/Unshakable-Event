## Top 5 Insights Across All Influencers

### 1. Volume + Consistency = Dominance
The highest-performing influencers publish at extreme volumes:
- **Alex Hormozi:** 250-300 pieces/week ($90K/month investment)
- **Andy Elliott:** 220+ pieces/month (98.6% YouTube like rate)
- **Brendon Burchard:** Daily content for 25 consecutive years

**Takeaway:** Content volume and consistency compound over time. The leaders invest heavily and never miss.

### 2. Content Repurposing is the Multiplier
Every influencer systematically multiplies content ROI:
- 1 live event = 100+ content pieces
- 1 long-form video = 30+ platform-specific derivatives
- AI tools increasingly automate this process

**Takeaway:** Create once, distribute everywhere. Build repurposing systems before scaling content.

### 3. Platform-Specific Strategy Beats Cross-Posting
Each platform serves a different purpose:
- **YouTube:** Long-form education, evergreen discovery
- **Instagram:** Testing ground, engagement, awareness
- **LinkedIn:** B2B credibility, high-value audience
- **LIVE:** Community building, high-ticket conversion

**Takeaway:** Optimize for each platform's strengths. LinkedIn audiences (40% earn $70K+) differ from Instagram.

### 4. LIVE Video Drives Highest ROI
Marathon and multi-day events generate extraordinary results:
- **Alex Hormozi:** $150M in 24 hours (Guinness World Record)
- **Tony Robbins:** 30,000+ virtual attendees
- **Russell Brunson:** 9 years of Funnel Hacking Live

**Takeaway:** LIVE creates urgency, commitment, and community. Repurposed live content extends value for months.

### 5. Value-First Philosophy Enables Soft Selling
The 85-10-5 rule (Tony Robbins) applies universally:
- 85% value content
- 10% shared/community content
- 5% promotional content

**Takeaway:** Lead with massive value. Audiences buy from trusted authorities, not aggressive sellers.
