- Valuable for specific people at specific times
- Less universal but still needed
- Good for depth but not reach
- Examples: Videos 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, 23, 25

## PLATFORM STRATEGY BY CONTENT TYPE

### HIGHEST VIRAL POTENTIAL (Videos 1, 8, 10, 26)
- Primary: Instagram Reels (extract 15-30 sec hooks)
- Secondary: TikTok (same clips + trending sounds)
- Tertiary: YouTube Shorts (compilation of hooks)
- Email: "You won't believe what Toby just said about..."

### HIGHEST DEMAND (Videos 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 16, 22, 26, 28)
- Primary: YouTube long-form (full story/explanation)
- Secondary: Instagram (reel extract + testimonials in comments)
- Tertiary: Email (daily digest of that day's video)
- Community: Challenge assignment (highest engagement)

### PERFECT BALANCE (Videos 5, 7, 15, 21, 27, 30)
- Viral AND Demanded
- These are your "star performers"
- Focus extra distribution effort here
- These become your "greatest hits" clips
