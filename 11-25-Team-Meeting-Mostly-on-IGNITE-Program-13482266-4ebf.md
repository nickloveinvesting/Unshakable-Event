**Meeting Date:** 25th Nov, 2025 - 8:12 AM

---

**Speaker 1** *[00:00]*: Lori. 
**Speaker 2** *[00:01]*: Lori had a mis community or screw up with the time because she's. She's always switching time zones. 
**Speaker 1** *[00:11]*: Oh, but she's in time zones. Okay. So I don't know what. 
**Speaker 2** *[00:13]*: I was like some tech issue that she. Anyways, who else did we miss? There was a Cynthia. Her phone's disconnected now, so I can't. 
**Speaker 3** *[00:23]*: Get a hold of her. 
**Speaker 1** *[00:24]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 4** *[00:25]*: Hence why she wasn't on the call. 
**Speaker 1** *[00:27]*: Yeah, yeah. Lots he said there. 
**Speaker 2** *[00:30]*: Eric said he couldn't make it. 
**Speaker 3** *[00:35]*: Yeah, it's just. 
**Speaker 1** *[00:37]*: When you. Who was the last one to leave last night? You. Did you shut all this off? Okay. For some reason, it disconnected from the WI Fi too. 
**Speaker 3** *[00:45]*: Oh, I just turned it off. 
**Speaker 4** *[00:46]*: Well, in my screen. My little screen was off again this morning. 
**Speaker 1** *[00:51]*: Your. Your frame. Your picture frame. Okay. Yeah. 
**Speaker 4** *[00:55]*: This was completely. 
**Speaker 3** *[00:56]*: I. 
**Speaker 1** *[00:56]*: Well, I didn't. 
**Speaker 3** *[00:57]*: I just didn't think that. I know these lights get hot. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:00]*: Yeah, yeah. No, no. I want you to make sure it wasn't the cleaning cre. That's why. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:04]*: No, they actually come early. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:05]*: When you left Friday, if you turned. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:07]*: It off, because I did too. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:10]*: I figured it was the cleaning crew came in. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:13]*: I mean, were shut down. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:14]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:15]*: But I didn't know if we had done that or not. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:17]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:18]*: Good. All right, so a couple things I did Sunday while I was here doing all this. I put Alex Ramosi's deal up. I'd already started listening to it. I was about two hours into it. So then when I got here, I listened to it good and bad. He gave away like 40 items. I mean, that giveaway was not just the 200 books. The 200 books was the tagline of paying it forward. He gave way, and I think I lost count. In the late 30s, counting on all his little courses and books and programs and everything is all titled under the hundred million dollar business models. Business models. He says it so fast that you. I mean, I ain't going to. Oh, Money models. Ye. 
**Speaker 3** *[02:07]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[02:08]*: Money models. Yeah. Money models. 100 million. Money mom. 100 million. Like, dude, slow the F down. But so. But something that. That did kind of click with me. And this is where opinions are welcomed. Not that it will be respected, but they're welcome. 
**Speaker 3** *[02:31]*: To. 
**Speaker 1** *[02:32]*: Yeah. Because this is the round table. It's not elongated head of the table, end of the table type. Does it matter? I'm just curious. 
**Speaker 4** *[02:48]*: I was just wondering if someone else. 
**Speaker 5** *[02:49]*: Was gonna say perception is reality. 
**Speaker 1** *[02:53]*: I'm. I'm trying. 
**Speaker 5** *[02:54]*: No, you do take a lot more opinions now than you did before. You have more valid opinions Is what. 
**Speaker 1** *[03:02]*: I think is I respect their opinion a lot more than I did previous people on the Ignite program. Here' what I'm thinking, for the individuals who have been loyal to us now we're going to gift them the Ignite program and then we're going to drop it for a December special to 1995. So if you enroll in December, your monthly subscription is $19.95. And here's the deal. 
**Speaker 5** *[03:40]*: It's like going forward, period, for anybody. 
**Speaker 1** *[03:43]*: That enrolls in December, we're gifting you or discounting it to 1995. And here's the philosophy and strategy that we have to get to. And this was a lot on this conversation, a lot of listening to Alex Hermosi. I mean, I didn't realize the guy had been around for 12, 13 years. He failed miserably for the first seven. And he says because he just didn't have value added products. He did, but nobody knew about him. There wasn't enough word. There wasn't enough promotion pushing. And he started with his gyms and he did pretty good through Covid on pivoting and moving the membership into a stack supplements. And this is one thing that I really did like about what he talked about was stacking stuff. Stacking value versus minimizing and limiting it because Randy may want something that's not in that original stack. 
**Speaker 1** *[04:38]*: So therefore Randy doesn't buy. But Nick saw all the AI stuff and he's like, shit, I'm in with no problem. Rochelle said, well, I really know need more about being a nicer wife and being able to understand how to deal with my bullheaded husband. And that was never offered, but it's over here on its own. So I'm out. And so because to mix and match, you mean. Well, just. Just stacks. If you do this, then I'm gonna throw in this. I'm throwing this. That brings into. So a couple of things. One is, so for the people that are on it, we give them lifetime membership, okay, for free. And then everybody, the current people that have been on it, there's like six, eight maybe. And then for December special, you're in Black Friday. However you want to market, label it. 
**Speaker 1** *[05:38]*: But we gotta go mark. It's gotta be. Act like if there's a value to it and we're gifting you the value. Anybody that signs up for this, and we need to. So there's a couple of Things. So it's 1995 lifetime subscription, so anybody that signs up in December gets a 1995 discounted. From 9.95. You now have a lifetime subscription at 1995amonth. 
**Speaker 4** *[06:07]*: As long as they stay on it. 
**Speaker 5** *[06:09]*: Every month, I don't care. As long as they pay, I don't care. 
**Speaker 4** *[06:12]*: If they drop, if they don't pay, rejoin, they don't. 
**Speaker 1** *[06:15]*: Correct. Right. 
**Speaker 5** *[06:16]*: It's a new membership. 
**Speaker 1** *[06:17]*: Yeah, it's a different membership, but that's. But not state, but right. Subscribe every month, whether they're on the call or not. We have to start chasing people and not money. The people have to bring us the money. So. And that's something that. That has been kind of the carrot or the cart before the horse chicken for the egg bullshit is to. Well, we need revenues, we need money, but we don't have enough presence to be able to charge what we know the value of the product is. Now, we have some testimonies today that are going to come in. We have the webinars that are starting hopefully in the next week or so, and we'll. And then we have all this with workshops. So in the next 12 months, which I hate that it'll be a different story. 
**Speaker 1** *[07:11]*: I hate, you know, that time is our biggest enemy. There is a lot that we can do between now and then to evolve it. But listening to his story, listening to that gave me a lot of clarity on. I think the only real person, and you know more about it than I do, that really skyrocketed to success was Andy Elliott. But I don't think he could have done it without Tony Robbins pushing and promoting him on stages of thousands of people way. 
**Speaker 3** *[07:45]*: And he just like built up a massive platform, didn't sell anything to a Facebook theory. Yeah, he made. Yeah, yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[07:51]*: Facebook theory. 
**Speaker 3** *[07:51]*: He made a bunch. And then, of course, people now like him now and buy from him. 
**Speaker 1** *[07:55]*: Right, yeah. 
**Speaker 3** *[07:56]*: Which is the time. 
**Speaker 1** *[07:57]*: I've always said that when were doing athletes, we're building Atlas and building that out. And Travis is all about subscription, subscriptions. And I said, I don't agree with that. I think we need to have members. Members, members. The Facebook theory. Give me 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 people that will promote it. Then I can launch it to 200,000 and a subscription. Because now there's a FOMO and it's got proof of concept. That was one of the things we thought about the most. So it's kind of got me a little bit gun shy, but I want to go back to that strategy and structure. We don't have near enough followers. You combine all my following and all my medias and I may be 25, 27,000. That is a drop in the bucket. I mean not even raindrop in the ocean. 
**Speaker 1** *[08:57]*: So we have to go get word of mouth out there now. One of the things that has to happen is I have to post something every day. Not what we're already doing through the ignite. Yeah, well, in the clips I'm gonna sit right here every morning with this and I'm gonna do. And I did that one time where I did the noise around us and I just jumped in my office got. Went on live and we had almost. We have almost 27,000 views on that inside a week now. Views, all this, but that's where it starts. And then you view it again and do it again and view it again. 
**Speaker 5** *[09:40]*: Part of their algorithm. 
**Speaker 1** *[09:41]*: It starts building and then I quit. 
**Speaker 5** *[09:44]*: Are you doing much on TikTok? Because you've shown up on my TikTok twice but not enough even liking it for it to get in my algorithm every day. Yeah, your Tick Tock is not showing up in my algorithm at all. And I've hearted and subscribed. So there's something with your algorithm then. And I know they changed some stuff on Tick Tock because I've got other people that have said the same thing. They're like, I'm losing. 
**Speaker 1** *[10:11]*: I haven't looked. 
**Speaker 3** *[10:12]*: No, I don't know what she's. What Taylor's been doing or posting. 
**Speaker 1** *[10:17]*: But so, and here's what I believe the problem is she goes into Opus Clip. She dumps the videos in there. It clips it and then she posts it through that. And I don't know. And that may be a restriction. What from us? 
**Speaker 3** *[10:35]*: I don't know. 
**Speaker 5** *[10:35]*: Because it could be Tick Tock too. I know that other people have had the. Had loss of views, but I haven't seen it and I should be seeing it since I. Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[10:43]*: If you're following and subscribing. But we post something every day, seven days a week. Okay. 
**Speaker 5** *[10:50]*: Yeah, I'll go back in and check and see. 
**Speaker 3** *[10:53]*: I mean like, you know, I would say just with the social media to that I remember reading. Oh, I forget what book it's called. But a guy who was talking about social media and he said that two biggest drivers of growth on social media are posting content with entertainment and emotion. Both of those things. They either, you know, something's entertaining and I want to share it and I want to show Angie because it's funny or something interesting or something emotional that's relatable, sad, happy, Whatever it might be. And then a small portion you would say would be education. So they were talking about those three E's, and so they. He was really kind of saying that entertainment emotion gets new people and education keeps them almost, in a way. We're almost like maybe flipping that. 
**Speaker 1** *[11:48]*: Trying. 
**Speaker 3** *[11:48]*: To grab people, but they're like, why did I listen to you? I don't know you. And maybe so I do. One of the things I was thinking about that I was gonna text you, Wesley, what would you think about? Even if it's just something that you have to see first on that, I do like people who are, like, open about this is what's going on in our company. This is how we're going. Like, the relatability of, hey, you know, we had this problem with this new office. Right. Or this just like almost a little bit more raw and honest, too. Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[12:21]*: And. 
**Speaker 3** *[12:22]*: And people, like, follow journeys too. And I think that's almost a cool idea too. That could be easy to add in. I just think that the biggest driver, I think, for growth is virality. And the way to get towards that would probably be more TikTok, I guess you might say, or TikTok YouTube Reels. 
**Speaker 1** *[12:47]*: I know that when were doing those apartments stuff. 
**Speaker 3** *[12:55]*: And I'm not even saying that stuff, like doing that. Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[12:59]*: But you're not wrong because when were doing all that, I mean, were getting 60, 80, 100 views and likes. 
**Speaker 3** *[13:07]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[13:07]*: You're getting people who are 1520-001970-00163,000, 19,000. 
**Speaker 3** *[13:16]*: Like a majority of the people that are going on, you know, myself or Rochelle's going on TikTok. I'm not going on to usually learn as much. 
**Speaker 5** *[13:24]*: It may want to scroll to shut. 
**Speaker 3** *[13:27]*: Your brain a little bit. 
**Speaker 4** *[13:29]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 3** *[13:29]*: And that. So like Bradley or Andy Elliott, they'll post something, you know, raw in their office from a conversation. But it might be something a little bit funny or something. I mean, like, we have those things all the time. 
**Speaker 1** *[13:42]*: 68,000. This is on Instagram now. 68,0001-150001-20000. And then I can't see those because it's a white background on all those daily deals. Can't see that. 130,000. So, I mean, we had. But. But those are also those dramas of the landlord having shitty tenants. 
**Speaker 3** *[14:09]*: People love it. 
**Speaker 1** *[14:10]*: People loved it. 
**Speaker 3** *[14:14]*: So even if you told, like, told a short story of, like, buying Evergreen and we put B roll over, would. It would probably get a decent amount of traction too. 
**Speaker 1** *[14:26]*: What's B roll where it puts the verb like. Like this, all this. And then it'll throw an image in there. Sometimes you can tell it to throw it. 
**Speaker 3** *[14:35]*: Capable. 
**Speaker 4** *[14:36]*: So engaged. 
**Speaker 5** *[14:37]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[14:38]*: It breaks it up with more visualization than just listening to somebody. So I don't disagree with any of that. And that's something that there's probably the biggest hurdle that we have to overcome is just awareness of who we are and what we do. Not that we don't have a good product doesn't. Not that we don't have great tools and abilities. Just nobody knows. Too few people know about it to care now. So I think that first and foremost we have to get the Ignite program out there more so because that is something that is simple, easy and scalable without a tremendous amount of time and energy and all that. So come up with some kind of Black Friday end of the year. Be a part of the Founders elite. So I don't care. But something to run that. We're launching this from 1990. 
**Speaker 1** *[15:46]*: From 999 to 1999. For a limited time only. Limited seating power would make it a FOMO view. I love what you did on the landing page in the book. Toby Potter. Landing page. That was very good. That was very good. I even put that in writing so you can frame. Was that good? 
**Speaker 2** *[16:10]*: So yeah, that'll go live today. 
**Speaker 1** *[16:12]*: Okay. We're meeting at 1:30 with Synergix add me. Yes. And I don't know why everybody's not adding. 
**Speaker 3** *[16:19]*: I'm not. 
**Speaker 2** *[16:20]*: We're not on Twitter because Nick is the speaker. 
**Speaker 3** *[16:23]*: The speaker one. 
**Speaker 1** *[16:23]*: Yeah. And then yesterday we had LoJo that you guys were supposed to be on and I had to tell him to get on it. And I knew you were busy so. 
**Speaker 3** *[16:32]*: I. I had no clue. 
**Speaker 1** *[16:33]*: I know. And I jumped his butt. And so that's when he. I sent you it. Then he emailed it to you. Okay. 
**Speaker 3** *[16:38]*: But I did look through all those documents though. 
**Speaker 1** *[16:40]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 3** *[16:41]*: Of his webinar and one like. So his in their document about your. I can't believe the presentation that you have that they have in the document. They're like, oh, this is gonna be your slide deck. It's 150 slides. 
**Speaker 1** *[16:55]*: Yeah. Yeah. Did you see that? Yes, I did. 
**Speaker 3** *[16:57]*: Jesus Christ. And I was like how long? 
**Speaker 1** *[17:00]*: Yes. We're not doing an eight hour webinar. Yeah. 
**Speaker 3** *[17:03]*: Or whatever. 
**Speaker 1** *[17:04]*: I was like, so we'll work through that. And the reason why I needed so in it. The first question. This guy didn't realize what the meeting was, but he was all about Go High Level. Okay. So I had to have Randy on it because I had no clue. 
**Speaker 3** *[17:17]*: Yeah, yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[17:18]*: So he was able to answer it. Click him through is getting them all. And were 20. 
**Speaker 3** *[17:22]*: So that's why you added a new admin. That's probably them. Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[17:25]*: Yes, yes. 
**Speaker 2** *[17:26]*: And I'm assuming they're gonna be building funnels. 
**Speaker 3** *[17:28]*: Did you look at their snapshot? I mean, I think. I mean I don't know, maybe. Maybe I should talk that. I just. I think some of their marketing is kind of weak. Do you the just like the headlines. 
**Speaker 1** *[17:37]*: For our product, for our books. 
**Speaker 3** *[17:39]*: It went out because I looked through all this and. And I was typing out an email but then I figured we'd probably meet about it somewhere. So what was. 
**Speaker 1** *[17:48]*: I guess so yesterday's meeting was just to integrate Go High Level to make sure we had our Go High Level set up the way they needed it. And that connected domains all the technical. Okay, yeah, that's all it was. It was like I said 20 minute meeting to make sure. And the only thing that we had to change was open up another domain because our booktobypotter.com ernesto host so we opened up drtobypotter.com so that we could have. We can control the DNS and all that. 
**Speaker 3** *[18:22]*: Okay. Well we also when if they're hopefully they're doing tracking or everything like that or adding a new pixel or something like that for all people making sure. 
**Speaker 2** *[18:31]*: His Facebook and all that stuff was. He checked everything to see what he needed. 
**Speaker 3** *[18:37]*: Okay, well we'll confirm all that. What was it? Yeah. Were you gonna talk again? I guess after that they were gonna. 
**Speaker 1** *[18:45]*: Once they go through. Okay. So at 1:30 we have a call with Synergix to make sure our link ins are done. 
**Speaker 3** *[19:00]*: I did make that page. 
**Speaker 1** *[19:01]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 3** *[19:02]*: Yeah, I mean I made that page and updated mine. Oh, did you have tasks? 
**Speaker 1** *[19:10]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 4** *[19:11]*: Over the seat. 
**Speaker 1** *[19:12]*: Yeah. So that's why we got to rewrite this board. 
**Speaker 2** *[19:18]*: I refine mine a little bit. 
**Speaker 1** *[19:20]*: Say that again. 
**Speaker 2** *[19:21]*: I refined mine a little. Are they going to give more tips. 
**Speaker 1** *[19:23]*: About what probably through today to look at it and say hey, let's add this. Let's remove that because now we can connect the unshakable. Yep, yep. Right. 
**Speaker 3** *[19:34]*: So I invited all of you to the page so she's probably at least a notification. But if you like change the job section and you type in as the company the unshakable you'll find it with the logo. So it's not too hard. What's your LinkedIn cover I have. I don't remember what it is. Do you want a new one? 
**Speaker 1** *[19:56]*: Wait, say that again. 
**Speaker 3** *[19:59]*: Your LinkedIn profile cover. You know you go to your profile and behind your. Your thing. Oh okay. So that's good. I didn't know if it was still Wait GIS thing. 
**Speaker 1** *[20:08]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 2** *[20:08]*: You guys got a notification about a new Ignite purchase. 
**Speaker 3** *[20:11]*: Is it new? 
**Speaker 1** *[20:12]*: Yeah, from I'm. 
**Speaker 2** *[20:14]*: I don't get those anymore. 
**Speaker 3** *[20:15]*: Then I got control of all that. 
**Speaker 1** *[20:17]*: So if you removed yourself I can't help you brother. That's your domain. You own that lane. 
**Speaker 3** *[20:23]*: Oh that's what I was saying we should talk to Newton, ask him why. Oh I might have actually added a question in Ignite of why they joined. 
**Speaker 1** *[20:33]*: Okay, perfect. Go to the unshakable self. No, I'm just saying for the LinkedIn. 
**Speaker 3** *[20:42]*: If you want to like on your. 
**Speaker 1** *[20:44]*: Jobs or connection to go find that page. 
**Speaker 3** *[20:47]*: It's the unshakable investor invest. 
**Speaker 1** *[20:49]*: Yeah that's what I was. 
**Speaker 3** *[20:52]*: Yeah. So we'll start putting. I didn't put any posts on it but need to. 
**Speaker 1** *[21:17]*: So we need to add this now into the Opus Clip domain so that everything goes into that. 
**Speaker 3** *[21:27]*: Yeah I. I love LinkedIn too just as a platform because like every like comment whatever is a reshare so like LinkedIn has a crazy amount of virality potential and your our target audience. I mean it's probably on there. 
**Speaker 1** *[21:47]*: So we got to add services. 
**Speaker 3** *[21:51]*: Yeah there was some stuff about that. 
**Speaker 4** *[21:55]*: Should we leave our like signature lines as direct funding resource or should we change those? 
**Speaker 5** *[22:08]*: Yeah I was gonna say I think I'll throw title way off if I'm got everything under different names. 
**Speaker 2** *[22:14]*: Yeah they haven't said well it doesn't affect you guys that much but I can. You can email from gohighlevel and I have a different signature when I email. 
**Speaker 1** *[22:24]*: From Go high level when you email from and I have it in outlook I have drop downs and signatures so my signature can change based upon who I'm sending to. I have five different signatures on. 
**Speaker 4** *[22:33]*: Well I didn't know if were trying to rebrand ourselves. 
**Speaker 1** *[22:38]*: Not yet. We have too many loans dealing with too much of that but these guys do these guys need to that's all anybody needs to understand and see that they're represented. 
**Speaker 5** *[22:50]*: Yeah cuz I mean I don't know. 
**Speaker 4** *[22:53]*: That Global Integrity Investments helps us any by marking that so it's just a umbrella company now subsidiary. 
**Speaker 1** *[23:05]*: That's correct. That's correct. So work on that. I'll be more diligent on daily 15, 20, 30 minute. Here's what's going on in our world. 
**Speaker 5** *[23:23]*: Kind of almost like a get ready with me. Like some of the. 
**Speaker 1** *[23:28]*: My original goal, and I don't know how to do this yet, was to film us working out. Yeah. 
**Speaker 5** *[23:34]*: You need to splice it up where you've got it throughout the day. 
**Speaker 1** *[23:37]*: But Randy showed up like, right at seven. No, I didn't. 
**Speaker 2** *[23:41]*: Showed up at 6:40. 
**Speaker 1** *[23:42]*: You did not. Yeah, I did. I promise you, son. It was 6:56. 
**Speaker 2** *[23:47]*: Oh, I walked in here when it was 6. I was invited by. 
**Speaker 1** *[23:52]*: I got to Allen at 6:45. I was here on time. 
**Speaker 2** *[23:57]*: No, I was doing my quiet time in there. 
**Speaker 1** *[23:59]*: You weren't here yet, dude. I got here at 6:30. 
**Speaker 3** *[24:03]*: No. 
**Speaker 2** *[24:03]*: Where was your truck? 
**Speaker 5** *[24:04]*: He's in the truck. 
**Speaker 4** *[24:06]*: Yeah, he's in here. 
**Speaker 2** *[24:07]*: I didn't see your car. 
**Speaker 5** *[24:09]*: They're in the parking garage. 
**Speaker 1** *[24:10]*: 6:30, brother. 6:30. I was here still. We could warm up and be ready to work out. 
**Speaker 2** *[24:18]*: I didn't see yours. Like, oh, he's running late. So I'm gonna do my quiet time. 
**Speaker 3** *[24:24]*: I have some bands I could leave here. 
**Speaker 5** *[24:26]*: I think we have some bands at home too, that are extras that we could bring. 
**Speaker 3** *[24:30]*: I love bands. Bands. 
**Speaker 5** *[24:32]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 3** *[24:32]*: You warm up with bands? 
**Speaker 1** *[24:33]*: Yes. 
**Speaker 3** *[24:34]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[24:35]*: But I see too many accidents with those. 
**Speaker 3** *[24:37]*: With bands. 
**Speaker 5** *[24:37]*: I think it depends on what you hook to some people. 
**Speaker 3** *[24:41]*: Yeah, I get. 
**Speaker 1** *[24:41]*: If you. 
**Speaker 3** *[24:42]*: If you put them on here. Yeah. You know, you got to watch that. 
**Speaker 1** *[24:45]*: And I'm not posting that crap because why. 
**Speaker 3** *[24:47]*: That'd be great. 
**Speaker 1** *[24:48]*: That would go. I know it does. 
**Speaker 5** *[24:50]*: Yeah. Let me let the guy that, you. 
**Speaker 4** *[24:52]*: Know smack the band. 
**Speaker 1** *[24:53]*: You're not wrong with the comedy. Because when I was doing the cold plunges, when the pool was cold in that first one, I got more activity from. Because when I jumped in and then came out, like, it's cold. 
**Speaker 5** *[25:04]*: People like to see uncomfortable things. 
**Speaker 3** *[25:07]*: They like to watch other people's stuff. 
**Speaker 5** *[25:10]*: You feel a little more validated, like, okay, so his life isn't perfect either. So it does seem to validate people to see that it's not always. 
**Speaker 1** *[25:19]*: It is. And you're not wrong. So we'll. We'll. We'll try to do more of that. That was obi ome. 
**Speaker 3** *[25:27]*: I mean, really, I even think, like, we should even play around with reposting the ones that did work. 
**Speaker 1** *[25:35]*: Yes. 
**Speaker 3** *[25:36]*: And like, those ones. I mean, it's been a while. I. That's what I would probably tell. 
**Speaker 1** *[25:41]*: While were in transition and moving and we wasn't doing any filming, I Had her find some of those high performance and repost them or. And it's. I'm not on all socials. Can you just repost it without. You have to go in there and change. 
**Speaker 3** *[25:58]*: That's what you should download it. Yeah. Really read. 
**Speaker 1** *[26:00]*: Right, right. She's ready to become an investor. I'm ready to get started in short term vacation rentals and foreclosures. Call me one free. 
**Speaker 4** *[26:16]*: I wonder what happened with her other program. 
**Speaker 1** *[26:20]*: Yeah, she paid a bunch of money for that. Made a bunch of money for it. So let's focus on everything that we do. Creating and generating activity. And we got. And then I'm going to be thinking through stacking. So I've got to finish the book so that we have that. And then we have to start looking at the paradigm of sales, entrepreneurship, business growth, those other spokes with a core to be able to stack and push and promote AI, which we know AI will tie into every deal. 
**Speaker 3** *[27:13]*: Yeah. In some fashion. I mean I was working a decent amount. I, I thought in my brain that it was gonna be easier to like build out the workbook and the content of it because that like it kind of, a lot of it stems from that it seems. I thought whenever were talking about not even just a work but that in general the nine, the like nine sections that it has. 
**Speaker 1** *[27:40]*: Let me ask you this. With Alex's books and I, I was doing all this while I was going. I had my ipod up, but all his stuff was online. All those books he was giving away. Not the 200 books, but all that stack stuff was all ebook courses. Right. 
**Speaker 3** *[27:59]*: He had a lot of ebooks. His like one of his main lead magnets. Actually. I thought about kind of doing a little bit here too. Was that what you hear in his YouTube all the time? It's. If you're, if you're a business owner, like you're inside of one of these 14 stages, whatever it is, you know, take. And if you like take the quiz, I'll show you like how to get to the next step. And I was like, I mean good. If we're doing sales or business or entrepreneurship, that's a good lead magnet because like I've seen it and it's the output. It shows you like you're in this stage and this is your pain point and it's probably right. And this is how you go to the next one, which is cool. And so I don't know. 
**Speaker 3** *[28:46]*: I mean he does have a Lot of the lead magnet information which I talk about with Randy a lot because people just love free stuff, especially when it's something that's new or something that is. 
**Speaker 1** *[28:59]*: So we need. I don't disagree. So. And that was one of the things is that we don't give away enough to validate who we are. So yeah, we need to take sections. Maybe let's. Let's grab three to five topics. Sales. Hey, I'm trying to scale sales and I'm running into objections. How do you overcome objections? Here's a free ebook register. Download it now. We've captured their information and we put in there 10 steps to overcome any and all objections. 
**Speaker 3** *[29:28]*: Right. Stuff like that. 
**Speaker 1** *[29:31]*: Just teasers. 
**Speaker 3** *[29:34]*: Written. 
**Speaker 1** *[29:35]*: Yeah, just enough. Just like what I did with Kyle that day. 
**Speaker 3** *[29:38]*: Right. 
**Speaker 1** *[29:40]*: You know, scale from 100,000 to. To, to. To 500,000 in 90 days if you're selling a what. So we can come up with those. And here's 10 steps. 
**Speaker 3** *[29:52]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[29:52]*: That you must be implementing to achieve that success. 
**Speaker 3** *[29:55]*: And, and I, I've like kind of workshopped just some ideas in there too. And make like the first one that I made too was that like doing your first. Doing your first real estate deal with no money. I mean that's like a. That's pretty buzzy. And then another one I thought would be like kind of related to our stuff is like. I forget what I call it, but it was going. It was playing off of the first 90 days that we originally had. And I had one that was called like the first seven days. Like going from no habit to habit essentially. Because I think that's like one of the more important aspects is like people, A majority of people will drop off in like the first week. And so too much work. 
**Speaker 1** *[30:35]*: Random boost. 
**Speaker 3** *[30:36]*: Too much. Yeah, sure. 
**Speaker 1** *[30:37]*: Too much work and not enough rewards. 
**Speaker 3** *[30:39]*: All of this. Yeah, all this which is just like. 
**Speaker 1** *[30:43]*: But this is where the masses have to come into our favor. 
**Speaker 3** *[30:46]*: Yeah. Yeah. And see, I mean that like writing the content like super easy. I would say I'm not worried about. 
**Speaker 1** *[30:53]*: Having the content I'm having. I'm more concerned about having the right message that creates that FOMO valuation. That we get those subscriptions and not subscriptions, but just database register for this and get that. 
**Speaker 3** *[31:10]*: Well, and that's like the thing. 
**Speaker 1** *[31:12]*: And maybe. Hold on. Maybe that's what we do. Register for the ignite for discounted 70, 80% discount on that. And we'll give you this too. Right. I like that. If we can get them, you can. 
**Speaker 5** *[31:29]*: Register for the ignite. Can you get The Ascend for free. 
**Speaker 4** *[31:32]*: And as in the cheapest one. 
**Speaker 5** *[31:34]*: Which one? 
**Speaker 3** *[31:35]*: That's a real estate one. 
**Speaker 5** *[31:37]*: Hold on. 
**Speaker 4** *[31:37]*: No, you're going back. 
**Speaker 5** *[31:38]*: Oh, I clicked on. 
**Speaker 1** *[31:44]*: This is Toby. Can I help you? 
**Speaker 5** *[31:49]*: Okay, yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[31:52]*: So Ignite is the cheat. That's right. Okay, we want 500 people on that call. 
**Speaker 5** *[31:58]*: Right? 
**Speaker 1** *[31:59]*: Right. We want 500 people on that call every Monday morning. And that's got to be our goal. That's our number one tag item in the next 45 days. That's what we got a gun for, whatever it takes. 
**Speaker 3** *[32:13]*: And that's. I like those kind of things. Those are, those are quantifiable. 
**Speaker 1** *[32:18]*: Quantifiable. So. So come January 1st, we got to go hell or high water to hit a goal of 500 people of the Ignite. And then, and then we're doing the ignite call in here and they're all members are on this wall. Does that make sense? We're showing them right here. We got the camera here and I'm sitting here and we're going through it and we're having our interviews and our one ones and all that. Now that screws things up for you in the fact that switching screens and all that. But we have the cameras now to do that. What we don't have is the multi switcher say why? Because those will be more intimate, more formalized deals. This is a. Everyday webinar. Well, not maybe webinar, but more of. Kind of like what you've always said about this. I want this homey environment. 
**Speaker 1** *[33:18]*: That's what this room is for. And that's what the short though that gives you both audience. Yeah, yeah, he was here yesterday. But this gives us now both studios. We've got this one that's more warm, cozy, environmental, friendly, open. But then we have the formalization of hey, let's do a. An interview. Let's do this, let's do that. But I do. 
**Speaker 3** *[33:43]*: No, but I should bring that. 
**Speaker 1** *[33:45]*: And maybe we could just sit here, flip that desk around so that you have your station here when we're filming in here. 
**Speaker 3** *[33:53]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[33:54]*: Because we have now plenty of cameras to do this with. 
**Speaker 3** *[33:56]*: Yeah, no, I, I think so. 
**Speaker 1** *[33:57]*: You. We just need another switch. 
**Speaker 3** *[33:59]*: Another switcher. 
**Speaker 1** *[34:00]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 3** *[34:00]*: Okay. We. Or were playing around with an idea that I thought because like what was really working that Randy was finding out was that people were signing up and clicking things and reading the text messages and maybe we should probably go down more email route. See why. But anyway, people don't. 
**Speaker 2** *[34:21]*: Yeah, because you can't Guarantee an email gets to you. It could go to spam, it could go to promotions, it could go to social. 
**Speaker 3** *[34:28]*: But. But email marketing is like, so I feel so important to what. 
**Speaker 2** *[34:33]*: Yeah, that's why I send both. I always do. 
**Speaker 3** *[34:35]*: But. So I was playing around with an idea because you can do it and go high level of a lead magnet. That was just like, we sent a text message, say, hey, you know, there's. There's this exercise right there, the seven levels of why. Except in order to make it just massively easy, I was playing around with. If you text back like seven levels, then it'll put you in. So then it's like, okay, here's how it works. And you're in it. You're in the text message and it's like, here, we're going to ask you seven questions. You're going to respond, and every next question includes their response from using. So it's like, okay, what's. And then it like. And they went all the way down. 
**Speaker 1** *[35:18]*: So like the five whys, when somebody says, I don't want to do this. 
**Speaker 3** *[35:21]*: Why? 
**Speaker 1** *[35:22]*: And then, well, because it's too expensive. Why is it too. 
**Speaker 3** *[35:24]*: Well, why is it too expensive? 
**Speaker 1** *[35:26]*: And. But then. So, yeah, so it's in the text. Yes. By the time you get to the fifth why, they've realized, I don't really have an out. Yeah. 
**Speaker 3** *[35:35]*: And then. 
**Speaker 1** *[35:37]*: Because it's going to take their responses and add the next question. 
**Speaker 3** *[35:40]*: Right, right. 
**Speaker 1** *[35:41]*: Based upon their response. Yes. 
**Speaker 3** *[35:44]*: And you probably know I was having so much trouble with the integration of it, just getting the right responses. But then the ending part and like, what we market, it would probably be something like the ignite program or something in the end and just like framing their why in it and all this stuff or. I don't know, I didn't quite finish it, but I was just testing. I was testing the idea and it was cool. 
**Speaker 1** *[36:11]*: Yeah, I love it. Because now you are getting true value of our ability to help you. 
**Speaker 3** *[36:20]*: Yeah. And. And, yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[36:24]*: So, you know, one of the things that really resonated with me was how you guys sent that ignite deal out. Had over 580 clicks, but then it died. But I think if we go back to that with that kind of a concept where they're immediately getting some value to say, yes, now I want. Because now you've proven to me proof of concept. Yeah, I love it. I love it a lot. 
**Speaker 3** *[36:51]*: Well, I guess we'll go see. I always remembered it as being seven levels, but, I mean, that is a lie. You think it should just be a five level thing. 
**Speaker 1** *[36:58]*: I've always been five. 
**Speaker 3** *[36:59]*: Yeah, that's weird, But respond. What? 
**Speaker 2** *[37:12]*: Toby's talking trash. 
**Speaker 5** *[37:15]*: Are y' all texting each other? 
**Speaker 3** *[37:18]*: Who's texting? 
**Speaker 4** *[37:18]*: I hate women. What the hell? 
**Speaker 3** *[37:21]*: Yeah, I don't know. 
**Speaker 1** *[37:26]*: Oh, and Chan Jan wanted to know if we made it and came worked out. I said yes, but Randy showed up late, but we got it done. He said, no, I wasn't. Now we all heard him say, I was in the parking lot. He wasn't in the gym. He wasn't warmed up, he wasn't stretched out. 
**Speaker 2** *[37:42]*: You're the one who called me last night and said, hey buddy, 6 is. 
**Speaker 3** *[37:45]*: A little too early. 
**Speaker 2** *[37:46]*: I'm gonna be there at seven. Be there at seven. 
**Speaker 1** *[37:48]*: And what time does seven at? What time to seven? It's seven to you. Coming from me, seven, six, four years know me car was not in the parking lot. I was in the parking lot. 
**Speaker 5** *[38:03]*: No, it was in the parking garage. 
**Speaker 1** *[38:05]*: It was in the parking garage. 
**Speaker 2** *[38:06]*: It wasn't where you normally park. 
**Speaker 1** *[38:07]*: So you're not wrong. 
**Speaker 2** *[38:08]*: He's not here. 
**Speaker 3** *[38:08]*: One of the first things you told me I started working here was talking about Toby time. That's one of the first things. 
**Speaker 5** *[38:15]*: You better be 15 minutes early to anything. 
**Speaker 3** *[38:23]*: So on the ignite, the two things that would be relatively easy that I wanted to add to, it was like, because I love the branding of ignite. It's very metaphorical. And I think that to add onto the program, you get in, we want you to do these things first. And, and then that like kind of gets you prepared to go to do the course and go into the live meetings. I think one of them should be that five levels. 
**Speaker 1** *[38:53]*: Why. I love the why. Or. 
**Speaker 3** *[38:55]*: And yeah, well, I also remember too, like there was a. I love the famous quote and I'm pretty sure it's. It's from Einstein where he says like a. A well framed question is 50% of the way to the soul dancer. And some people like. Right people have problems here. And then I just, I feel like there could be like some exercise or something that they could read where it like really pinpoints, like where is your real pain point? 
**Speaker 1** *[39:25]*: So let's. Let me ask you, as you're saying that I'm thinking through. So in this assessment or questionnaire, they would. We would need to create subject matter. So where's your pain? Is it sales? Is it business growth? Is it personal growth? We need to come up with 4, 5, 6 categories. Then once they click that. Because unless. Unless you have it designed differently to where the algorithm is going to create a. If he's one more direction on how do I increase my sales? Well, depends upon what you're selling, number one. But we would need to be like you said, 50% of the answer is framing the. Framing the question. Right. And if we don't have the right, and this is where sales fails, people show up and throw up. 
**Speaker 1** *[40:20]*: Meaning I have a product, I have a service and you need it, I know you need it, so I'm here to shove it down your throat. But see, I don't know what he needs because I never took five seconds to ask him what he needs. And if he would tell me what he needs, then I can frame my answer accordingly. That's how you excel in sales. But sales people don't do that. They're so excited about who they are, what they do. They show up and they throw up and they're shoving their product down your throat and you're like, that doesn't solve my problem because I don't sure, I can use your product, I can use your service, but that's not my problem. And that's where they missed the deal. And that's I think why I was so successful. That's why. Yes, I don't disagree. 
**Speaker 3** *[41:02]*: What'd you say? 
**Speaker 1** *[41:04]*: So we're so two things that are developing right now and this is pretty profound. Number one, Shark Tank, Kevin Harrington and all that work. They have this high end clientele that they want in the Shark retreat. 
**Speaker 4** *[41:21]*: Yeah, qualified. 
**Speaker 1** *[41:22]*: You know, you have to do 5 million a year in revenues and have at least a million dollar net profit and all that. Well, you know how many people are in between all that and they just discard them. So we're taking them into the middle pool so people that come to them that don't qualify can come to us into the middle pool and we'll help them launch, grow and scale to the Shark Tank level. Okay, Number one. Number two, they don't coach. So they have just like with us when went to them, I didn't want marketing, I wanted coaching, guiding and direction to take my speaking and coaching to the next level. I wanted somebody to help me scale up. Right. They don't do that. Almost every business comes from. Brenda had 21 people. 
**Speaker 1** *[42:04]*: So at the deal she went to Tennessee, the Shark retreat. She met with 21 people there who don't need Kevin Harrington and BBV. They need Toby Potter, they need coaching, they need scaling up. So she's now says we have that product. So now what we're doing is meeting with Tim and Kevin Harrington and saying we want a joint venture with you. You guys push your marketing, your gadget as seen on tv. And then we will pick up all the coaching side so you can wrap a package up and say, we'll market your stuff and we'll coach you to success. So that's why we have a Brenda, because she doesn't piss anybody off or. 
**Speaker 4** *[42:50]*: Discard any of them. Come in and they need the board of directors. They need the it. 
**Speaker 1** *[42:55]*: Yeah, they need the AI. They need. Yeah. 
**Speaker 4** *[42:58]*: And so once we actually. And that was my thing to him is, you know, DVD never listened to. To us. They never listen to what they wanted. 
**Speaker 3** *[43:08]*: They're fighters. 
**Speaker 4** *[43:09]*: Once we listen and figure out what actually they need, then we build the package. And if they need some it, they need this, they need that, and then we offer that. And they're like, okay, but I can only do it on this scale. Well, then if you. You can only do it on this scale, then we can do this. And then once we get going, we can add this and make it to where it actually works for that. 
**Speaker 1** *[43:33]*: Just like what? Alex Hermosi and Tony Robbins. Who. I've watched a shitload on here the last two weeks. I never liked it. I got all this stuff, but I never like to listen to him. But I've learned to like him. You start out here, but then because of that value, because of that growth, you can upsell them year after year, and they become alive. Lifetime client. 
**Speaker 5** *[43:57]*: They're bought in. 
**Speaker 4** *[43:58]*: They're bought in. They drank the koolaid. 
**Speaker 1** *[44:00]*: Yeah, they drink. They're coming up with different flavors of the Kool Aid. 
**Speaker 5** *[44:04]*: People that get an instant gratification from you will be your biggest salesman. 
**Speaker 4** *[44:09]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[44:11]*: We take it to the next level. 
**Speaker 4** *[44:12]*: Grows, and we just start providing new services to them. 
**Speaker 1** *[44:16]*: Yeah. I hate when you get this quiet. I know you're thinking and absorbing, but I hate it because I think you're like, oh, this is motion. I mean, I'm bored to death. I'm going to go to sleep. You. You. 
**Speaker 2** *[44:26]*: I don't think that at all. 
**Speaker 1** *[44:27]*: I know. You don't even learn. I know you're soaking it in and you did this the other morning. I'm like, randy's pissed about something now we've offended him. We told him that olive oil is good for you. 
**Speaker 4** *[44:39]*: I don't think. 
**Speaker 3** *[44:40]*: No, we. No, just listen. 
**Speaker 1** *[44:41]*: We're. 
**Speaker 3** *[44:42]*: We're just. We're soaking through the details. I know you. Yeah, we're. 
**Speaker 4** *[44:45]*: Oh, Listen, he said we. How sweet is that? 
**Speaker 3** *[44:49]*: Tell me I am too. 
**Speaker 1** *[44:51]*: Yeah, yeah, but I. I do think this is. 
**Speaker 3** *[44:56]*: It's good. People get into ignite and they like, have like a bit of something to do once they join and something like that. 
**Speaker 1** *[45:04]*: Did you see Abby's post? Did she post that too? 
**Speaker 3** *[45:08]*: Wish we could get notifications, so. Goddamn. 
**Speaker 1** *[45:11]*: And maybe she just. 
**Speaker 2** *[45:12]*: I check it every day, but I didn't see it when I left yesterday. 
**Speaker 1** *[45:15]*: But she. After Monday's call and maybe it was an instant message to me. I just know that I got it. She was like. 
**Speaker 4** *[45:26]*: What did y' all think of switching up the call Monday and adding somebody to it? 
**Speaker 2** *[45:30]*: It was a good change of pace. 
**Speaker 3** *[45:32]*: Yeah, it was. 
**Speaker 1** *[45:34]*: I don't know, maybe it was an email. But anyway, she was grateful, thankful, appreciative, just like she said on the call. I've been trying to get with you, Brenda, but I know there was a disconnect. I realized now I wasn't ready. Now I see that I am and I see that you do. I mean, there was that acknowledgment and, you know, validation of who we are and what we're doing. Yeah. So I was very excited about that. We just have to have more. Yeah, we just have to have more. So that has to be our target. That has to be our goal. And strategy marketing is the key to all of it. That's, you know. Yeah. And that's the other thing. Listen to Alex. Eight months in development. $4 million spent to run that eight hour webinar. $4.2 million he spent up front. 
**Speaker 3** *[46:38]*: And you know, he. He tested 3,000 ads. 
**Speaker 1** *[46:41]*: Yeah. 3,000 ads to find the seven that worked. 
**Speaker 3** *[46:45]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[46:46]*: Seven that worked. 
**Speaker 3** *[46:47]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[46:48]*: I don't have that patience. 
**Speaker 3** *[46:50]*: I know. 
**Speaker 1** *[46:51]*: And I. That's on me. 
**Speaker 5** *[46:52]*: It's a lot to come. I mean, that's a lot of ads. 
**Speaker 1** *[46:54]*: But that's. 
**Speaker 3** *[46:56]*: What it is. 
**Speaker 1** *[46:57]*: And Thomas says, I found 3,000 ways it doesn't. I found 3,000 ways that it doesn't work. Not that they were all failures. 
**Speaker 5** *[47:04]*: Right. 
**Speaker 1** *[47:05]*: It just was. I had to go through the process of elimination to get to the right. 
**Speaker 5** *[47:10]*: Directive to be able to know why each ad didn't work is what is impressive to me. 
**Speaker 4** *[47:15]*: Don't really have an event going on yet because. 
**Speaker 1** *[47:18]*: But he was. And it was registrations he was banking on. Was he getting enough likes? Clicks and registrations? Just like they had 580 clicks, but zero. So. So the surface was right. It got attention overnight, but then it dropped off because why? We don't know. So they would take that same ad and now tweak the back the next level until they got to some growth. Oh well out of the 500. Yeah. 
**Speaker 3** *[47:51]*: Whenever I've read a lot too about it I've seen like we could do a similar ads except it's straight to the page to get the lead magnet, whatever it is, name, email done and that's, that would probably get a. 
**Speaker 1** *[48:07]*: Lot more people if you took that same ad that one that you guys did and the back end was if you want, if you're struggling here, here take this to get to the next level. Take answer these five questions to get to the next level and then they ask, they answer the five whys. 
**Speaker 5** *[48:31]*: Because it can't be too long. Six, seven questions in then they're like dude this is a lot of work. 
**Speaker 1** *[48:39]*: I think the assessment it's is. I don't think we have enough proof of concept and it's too personal for people to want. They just get. I don't want to know that I'm broken, not broke, dead financially I'm broken. I don't want to know that I'm broken. I don't. But I want you to fix me. 
**Speaker 4** *[48:58]*: I, I know I'm broken but I don't want anyone else. 
**Speaker 1** *[49:01]*: Well and it's not so much I just don't. I'm in denial. 
**Speaker 5** *[49:03]*: Some people aren't self aware enough to know. They don't understand that their business isn't growing because it's their personal not their business that they need coaching on. So I'm not self aware enough. 
**Speaker 1** *[49:14]*: Positive hey, if you're, if you're doing a hundred thousand dollars a month and want to get to a million dollars a month in sales, answer these five questions and we'll get you there type deal. So we capture their name, phone number, email address, they do the five whys and from that we have to have that conclusion that call to action now with a here's the resolution, here's the result, here's why did you. And it has to bring value. Well shit, that was amazing. Let me now let me register to go to the next level is how I'm seeing it escalate through without any of that I'm done. 
**Speaker 3** *[49:54]*: Well that's where yeah I mean the most recent landing page had the five questions assessment. I don't remember if it was really ran for too long. 
**Speaker 1** *[50:03]*: I don't remember. 
**Speaker 3** *[50:03]*: I don't know if at all. But. And it was very. And it was very straightforward. 
**Speaker 1** *[50:10]*: But I still, I'm giving you information with the hope that you give me resolution and not giving you resolution after each question. A value add after each question. Hey, you answered this. So here. So see what I'm saying? Each question, each answer to each question has to give them value. Then they go to the next question because. Oh, that's pretty insightful. I didn't realize that. So here's. So. So because of this, am I making sense? 
**Speaker 3** *[50:46]*: I see. If you're, if you're saying like, oh, like what, you know, why. Why are you here? Well, I want to start a business. Well, you know, you obviously have an entrepreneurship value. Why do you want to start a business? Is that what you mean? 
**Speaker 1** *[51:01]*: Or no. So. So as an example, I'm in sales. I'm in car sales, and I'm selling 20 cars a month, and I need to sell 50 cars a month. How do I get there? So the first question is, See, this is where it gets really. 
**Speaker 3** *[51:19]*: Well, no, actually, well, that's part of the point where I was talking about the question. Because like most people say, why am I not selling cars? But like, it's actually like, the better question is like, why are people not buying cars from me? And if you want to go more down. 
**Speaker 1** *[51:36]*: That route, and one of the things that Hermosi said repeatedly, and Tony Robbins says this too, this is backed by science, not theory, not feelings. This is backed by science, which then validates that this has been proven, it's been challenged, it's been proven to found worthwhile. Does that make sense? And so when we're doing this. So maybe this is where your responses come back, that car sales, 76% of people buy cars based upon this. Are you implementing this in your conversations now? 
**Speaker 3** *[52:20]*: Well, I mean, that, yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[52:21]*: And then the next one, well, no, I do this. So I'm just thinking out loud real quick. But. But we have to create validation into how is success achieved. Not for you, but for everybody. And within that, you know, 76% of people say, when I go to buy a car, here's what I'm looking to achieve. When I go buy a car, I already know what I want. I just need to know which is the best one you have on the lot and why. I know I want an F250 truck that has this, and this. Show me this. Don't go, show me Toyota Camry. Don't go show me. Because you're getting a higher commission on this. And maybe that's the other thing, maybe 62% of car sales people fail because they do this or they don't ask these questions. 
**Speaker 1** *[53:15]*: Something that resonates with them, like, that makes sense. That's how I'm thinking now. I don't know how to create. 
**Speaker 3** *[53:24]*: Well, it's. It's really like that. I feel like we can pretty easily get people somewhere. It's that. 
**Speaker 1** *[53:31]*: It's the conversion problem. Aha. Moments in those answers. 
**Speaker 3** *[53:39]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[53:41]*: And it can't be at the end. We have to continue having them nibble on the hook. Along the way. They took a little bite. Tasted pretty good. I'm gonna take another bite until they swallow the hook. 
**Speaker 3** *[53:55]*: Okay. All think on that one. 
**Speaker 1** *[53:58]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 3** *[53:58]*: And so we in tandem. Right. And then we. We should just test more than. 
**Speaker 1** *[54:04]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 3** *[54:04]*: One thing. 
**Speaker 1** *[54:05]*: Twenty. 
**Speaker 3** *[54:06]*: And. 
**Speaker 1** *[54:08]*: There can be no limit until we've perfected it. Well. 
**Speaker 3** *[54:12]*: And then it's like, you know, part of the other reason why I like the ignite assessment. The ads we didn't really spend, you know, too much money on going through there was, you know, it's supposed to be a funnel from there. So you give them all of this stuff, but that's all. That's only good. 
**Speaker 1** *[54:28]*: And. 
**Speaker 3** *[54:28]*: Well, if we're getting them, you know, through and down. So I know there was, like, me and Lexi were doing that 16 personalities test, and then were just like, oh, like, what's another personality test? And we found another one, and we did these, like, 20 questions, and they were really good. And then by the end, it asked you to pay for it. Like, oh, man. You know, but we almost did, but then we did it, even though the value was there. 
**Speaker 1** *[54:56]*: And I've done that probably in the last two weeks, different speaking and coaching deals. I've gone through their questionnaire, and then it's Ready for a $99am I condemned? 
**Speaker 5** *[55:08]*: But it either pisses you off or intrigues you. 
**Speaker 1** *[55:11]*: There wasn't enough value for me. Yeah. I didn't know I've seen so much. Yeah. There wasn't enough value at the end for me saying, that's the missing element that I need to get us to the next level. And so. And then. And. But now, of course, you get seven texts a day. Hey, I see that you got here. I know you're ready to make the move and all that. 
**Speaker 4** *[55:32]*: They already captured you. 
**Speaker 1** *[55:33]*: Well, but that's what we've got to do, because there may come a point in time later in my life, but now I need them. It's just not right now. And this is what we're not doing is every person, those 580 people need to be getting hit every day. Hey, I saw you did this. What are you looking for? How do we get you there? We need more follow ups on that. This is what we're missing. Part of what we're missing and that's. 
**Speaker 3** *[55:59]*: What the whole hopefully the marketing guys that we have is to set up the Facebook pixel correctly because you can get people's information from them just going to the pages. If they have certain stuff there, they're emailing where they're at or however it might be. But that's part of why the email is so important too is getting those people through and emailing them to try to continue to push them. And the second that they buy something right. It's so much easier to sell them something else because something that I think. 
**Speaker 1** *[56:33]*: About on those 500 plus people, maybe we say, hey, I know you were inspired by this. I know you saw value into this. Hey, what I'm gonna do is gift you this one session and we get them on the Monday morning call and then we see how many of those people actually got on the call. Then those go to another bucket of yeah, if we're not creating value. There was something that piqued interest, something in that ad that you guys created value to them to a degree. Now they lost value and we lost them. But we've got to go back to them now and we have to hit them every day with a call to action. So I would say the next move would be to those 500 plus people is hey, I know you saw value. Something was appealing. 
**Speaker 1** *[57:28]*: Not sure exactly what you're meaning to get to the next level, but what we would like to do is invite you to this is a one time and then you create a one time link for our ignite deal and then of that see how many of those people got on. Those people that got on goes into a whole nother bucket. The other 410 that didn't. We just keep drip campaigning them with new value add content. I get them all day long. 
**Speaker 3** *[57:59]*: Yeah, I mean Alex Mosey has mozy minute. Yeah, he emails every day. 
**Speaker 1** *[58:07]*: Right? 
**Speaker 3** *[58:08]*: Daily stoics. Yeah, I love the deal. I tried to workshop a daily thing like kind of in the. In the brand idea because I think that's really beneficial. The guy who wrote Atomic Habits, James Clear, he had his. He had an email. It was like a three, two, one email thing is what he called it. It was on Tuesdays and Thursdays only. But I Opened every single one every single time. Because like every email was so good. It was like here three things to think about. Here's two things I learned this week and here's one thing from history and that and every. And it was all very short. But because I opened it one time, I opened it every time after and it's very related. Yeah. And it was something that I was intrigued in. And so there's just. 
**Speaker 3** *[59:04]*: That's where the cult comes from is. 
**Speaker 1** *[59:07]*: I think we have a full understanding of what we're trying to establish and create. The variable the meat on the bone is implementation. And here's where I need you two to be. Very outstanding. 
**Speaker 3** *[59:27]*: Spoken about. 
**Speaker 1** *[59:28]*: So you said the marketing team. But we have to understand that both marketing teams are very limited and very. 
**Speaker 3** *[59:36]*: Well. There's something that you can set up like globally and that's what I say. 
**Speaker 1** *[59:40]*: So if we need a globally marketing team that can help establish, create and implement, then we need to create that. 
**Speaker 3** *[59:50]*: Well, I thought the best idea that. That you had was having one of those VA guys call. I feel like the call. The calling is a good idea if we have the. 
**Speaker 4** *[59:59]*: So I was. 
**Speaker 2** *[59:59]*: That's how you've been asked a question. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:00:03]*: Yeah, I know. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:00:07]*: It'S freezing in here. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:00:08]*: Really sweating like a pig. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:00:10]*: I didn't think it was that cold. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:00:12]*: I was getting ready to go crank it down. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:00:14]*: I looked yesterday, I was like it is so cold in here. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:00:16]*: It's on six. You got your heater? 
**Speaker 5** *[01:00:18]*: No, I got my heater running so. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:00:22]*: And I've tried bumping them to like 72 to 74. And I don't think they. I don't think I'm doing it. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:00:27]*: It's not as cold in my office as it is. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:00:31]*: So that's where now I know you were going to spend some time trying to validate her calls. 400 calls or whatever and validate and try to set that up where we actually recording and tracking all that ring. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:00:44]*: Sense only records after 30 seconds or a minute. So she has to actually talk to. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:00:49]*: Somebody and she's not leaving messages. So that's a problem because no matter what ring central won't know if the voicemail kicks on. It's not going to know. That's not a live question. But if she's hanging up the minute. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:01:03]*: That the voicemail leaving voice because I specifically talk. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:01:07]*: So a voicemail is going to be 30 to 50 seconds. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:01:10]*: I told her she did not need. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:01:11]*: To leave them and then she's got to leave a 20, 30, 40 second. So you got a minute and a half call minimum on everything. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:01:17]*: I think what she's doing is if they're not answering, she's immediately texting them. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:01:23]*: But she needs to leave a voicemail. And then in the text say hey Johnny, I just left you a voicemail. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:01:28]*: I gotta tell you something. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:01:29]*: I got something I need to tell you. So if you could give me a call back. Does that make sense? 
**Speaker 3** *[01:01:34]*: So. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:01:35]*: But she does have to leave a voicemail. Hey Johnny, this is Jelly at Direct Funding Resource. We've got some really big promotions. Give me a call as quick as you can. So that girl, that sense of energy, of urgency and energy in that. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:01:49]*: That girl that was on the call, that's the new VA or something. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:01:53]*: And I've got three more I'm trying to interview, but I, because I do want people just calling our Ignite clients exclusively to get feedback. To get what are they looking to have more of a follow up as to hey, you click this. What are you looking for? How can we help you? And then come to you guys say hey, I talked to Susie, she clicked this deal, but here's what she's looking for. And then we create a value email to her. That makes sense. Those VAs are dirt cheap. They're $230 a week. There's a lot can be done that. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:02:31]*: Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean it work. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:02:34]*: I like agree like Nicholas didn't work, so he got canned. And I didn't pay crap for. I paid 30 bucks for his two weeks of work. I got to go jump on a Zoom. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:02:46]*: Are you not paying him? 
**Speaker 1** *[01:02:47]*: Well, they tried to fight it and we luckily had validation that the guy made 32 calls in 33 hours. Yeah, he was making like a calling out and the calls are only 20 seconds long. It wasn't like he was on a 30, 40 minute call. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:03:02]*: So you go, okay, you made 30 calls at 20 seconds. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:03:06]*: Yes. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:03:07]*: An hour. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:03:08]*: Yeah, he spent two hours. We ended up. He worked for two hours. What was calculated. I paid him two hours. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:03:16]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:03:17]*: Yeah. So they are good at that. They've sent me more. I've got back to back Zoom calls or testimonials. Once I get those, I'll send them to you. We can add them to. And I'm sending them to. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:03:31]*: You have a Zoom call for testimonials. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:03:34]*: Yeah, it's three of our investors to talk about why they like working. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:03:39]*: Did you do win also? 
**Speaker 5** *[01:03:41]*: No, because I can't get a hold of wins. I don't know what they would say. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:03:43]*: They left us six Months, six weeks ago. They left. They just ghosted it. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:03:47]*: I can't. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:03:47]*: After the last webinar we did with him. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:03:50]*: What's his name? 
**Speaker 5** *[01:03:51]*: Toby Ripto. Can't get a hold of him. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:03:53]*: Webinar you did with him? 
**Speaker 1** *[01:03:54]*: Well, podcast. I did a podcast with. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:03:57]*: He didn't email me. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:03:58]*: And it was such a bad setting on her camera. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:04:01]*: You're talking about the rehabs. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:04:06]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:04:07]*: No, no. Wins didn't do rehabs. They were all DSer. You're talking about DeShawn Nelson. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:04:11]*: Yeah, Nelson. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:04:12]*: He is on a call today. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:04:13]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:04:13]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:04:15]*: So yeah, so I'll have those. They'll be short. Less than 10 minutes. We may do longer, but they will be able to chop it up to add the testimonials or our webinar so that we have live testimonials. Why people use this. Work with this. You have the ones that you posted on the booktubey Potter.com. So that gives us almost 10, 12 different testimonials. Sure to be able to show. Hey, here's a. You know, don't take my word. Listen to Reuben. What Dr. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:04:46]*: Clip out. Just because I'm assuming you're. You're conducting it like an interview. You're asking him a question. And then there he. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:04:54]*: Her mostly did. In fact, he didn't even have live ones. He just read them off. They were just Facebook posts. Oh yeah. He didn't even have post. Yeah. Jason Wojo had live. Hey. Hey. Randy, this is Jason. Glad I caught you. Hey, I know you've been a customer with us for the last eight weeks. Tell the audience what we've done for you and you would then just go right into. Those are all lies. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:05:19]*: I mean, by all means. Abby's is a written. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:05:23]*: Well, couldn't you go back to just our like where people have commented even with global integrity on four or five. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:05:31]*: Or six years old. Yeah, we don't think recent. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:05:34]*: Yeah, that's the problem. Okay. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:05:35]*: But that I've pulled. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:05:37]*: We have stuff in our community that you could do. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:05:40]*: Yeah, yeah. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:05:42]*: Taking quotes. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:05:43]*: Abby's email. She emailed you or messaged you? 
**Speaker 1** *[01:05:47]*: She messaged me somewhere. I have to find her. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:05:49]*: Yeah, that works as a yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:05:51]*: Yeah. So I've got to go jump on this. You guys can continue what you guys need to hammer down. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:06:06]*: And go over his head. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:06:07]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:06:09]*: Yeah. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:06:09]*: So once you get done with that, you gotta go to the board. I will. And I think black will best. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:06:13]*: Yeah, I think. Yeah, I think I've got one in the office. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:06:18]*: Make sure it's Fresh. And we have new ones, don't we? Buy some new Expo markers. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:06:24]*: Oh, they'd be all. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:06:28]*: Where your big. Where your. The big cabinets that there were. I'm pretty sure there were new Expo markers in there at the old office. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:06:34]*: That's why Taylor has. There might be some new ones. Tomorrow's job for her. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:06:40]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:06:40]*: Okay, I'll find one and get started. Yeah, I just want to go through the HUD with toy because he's supposed. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:06:46]*: To sign on that table and he had questions. Yeah, it has the trunk of excellent. And then. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:06:54]*: So I'll go. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:06:55]*: And then if you guys think of any tasks, I need them put. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:06:58]*: Well, that's what I have. My office kind of looks like that. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:07:02]*: Yeah. Can you compartmentalize? I did secular state stage, spiritual stage, school stage. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:07:10]*: I meant to where you're not taking up on board. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:07:12]*: No, that's my board. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:07:13]*: Well, there's still room. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:07:14]*: You have three in your office. 
**Speaker 5** *[01:07:16]*: There's room right beside the air conditioner. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:07:18]*: Is that. I don't. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:07:18]*: No, that's not. That's the only whiteboard. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:07:20]*: That's the only white. No, you. That's my wall. No, you don't get it. You get your own. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:07:24]*: Okay. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:07:25]*: Now, if you want. 
**Speaker 2** *[01:07:26]*: I wasn't using. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:07:27]*: If you want, you can hang that whiteboard up there or what she. We have two that can be repurchased. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:07:34]*: Where's the one that got broken? 
**Speaker 1** *[01:07:36]*: It's on. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:07:36]*: It's right around that one way back there. That back wall is a whiteboard. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:07:40]*: No, you can't use that. 
**Speaker 3** *[01:07:42]*: Is. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:07:42]*: It really looks at like. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:07:43]*: No, it's not. 
**Speaker 4** *[01:07:45]*: Well, it. The paint doesn't match. 
**Speaker 1** *[01:07:47]*: Then I think it's shading. Yeah. You can use this one. And it'll stand up right here, right now.
